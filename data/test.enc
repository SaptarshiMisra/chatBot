I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You got something on your mind?
Hi.
The "real you".
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
They do to!
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Neat...
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Why didn't you tell me?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I just wanted --
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
No, but
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Get out!
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Number one.  She hates smokers
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
You makin' any headway?
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Two legs, nice rack...
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who's that?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
What's this?
Okay?
Dorsey.
Wholesome.
So what's your excuse?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Is that a request or a command?
No, I won't go with you
It's just something I had.  You know
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
I know.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Tempestuous?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
Did I have anything to say about it?
We should have seen land.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
May I ask by whom?
No...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Chief knows.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
God... That's in a week!
Father Marchena!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
What's he doing?
Where can I meet this man?
We're lost!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Now I become custody of police department?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Do you have coffee?
I'll make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Only one guys checked in?
Are you hit?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
What would you call her?
My folks are.
I'll let you know what happens.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
Alright.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Who is he?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Whore?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
What is it?
Why not?
What is that?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious.
Traitor!!
Robert...?
Isn't he a little moody?
No.  Go ahead.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah?  What kind?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Really.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
CONTINUED
CONINUED
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
That's true.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Yeah?
Name?
You're in a hurry.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here you go, baby.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
Bullshit.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Well?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
How did they get away?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
How do you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Stall.
How ya doin'?
Surprise, Luther.
You chickenshit punk...
Let her go.
You sure?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Leeloo's in trouble?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
What are we going to do?
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Leeloo... is... she's...
Do you love her?
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
At least, the cat comes back.
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
6... 5...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
You know how to fly this thing?
It's my wife.
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Apipoussan?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
...Like love...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The cash man!
Have you identified it?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Wait or act.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
You should have.
You're killing me...
Anything harder?
Snuff?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
What's the problem?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Yeah, who's this?
What the fuck are you.. ?
Who is Machine?
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Give me the film.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
I'm not a cop.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Wha... ?
Who is he?
You don't need to be here.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
It won't work like that.
Hello... ?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
What was she running from?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I didn't mean to...
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
How... how can you say that to me...?
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
I'm sure they're around.
You what?
You in a hurry?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
How long have you been awake?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Nice neighborhood.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
What's wrong with me?
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Who says I don't like you?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I'm so sorry, honey...
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I thought about that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Reef!
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
I think you're right.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
As we near the Pole...
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
But - what can we accomplish?
That's a <u>face</u>???
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Who?
Who?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
Oh.
You see it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
No, I mean whereabouts.
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
Open the door, will ya?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Dad.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
How you holding up, Wade?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
See. Get your boots.
Good. Who?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Then... I guess you have to.
Oh, Wade.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
I know your parents.
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
It don't look right.
Just do it.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Yeah.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
What about Margie?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
There they are!
They aren't answering their hails.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
That's affirmative.
Who did this?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
How?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
And all these rooms here?
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
There goes your ride.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
May I speak to you for a moment?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Someone should give you a raise.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Thank you for calling the white House...
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What?
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Roger.
That's not possible.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Can I hold him?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Both pilots!
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Can't you take a guess?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Elaine!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Excuse me, Sister?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
You don't have squat.
William Harcourt?
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What is this?
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Tell me.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Who is he?
Was.  Divorced.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
Please, I must get out here.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Get outta there!
Movement!
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Could it be intelligent?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
No.  There's no way!
That's right.
That the atmosphere processor?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
What is it?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Save it.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's inside the complex.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
I knew you'd come.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
How do you know?
What's that?
What does he look like?
The marriage!
How was I? Tell me honestly.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Why?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
There's a young girl to see you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Why not?
It is miraculous.
This is not his handwriting.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Really?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
My pleasure.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Why so?
Yes, where?
What do you mean, Sire?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Well, what do you have for me today?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Why not?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Why? What has happened?
Where?
Sssh!
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Do you have a daughter?
Ah. Italian?
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
But what is it they don't like?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
You flatter me.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Are you ill?
What?
Yes.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
And that's all?
That's wonderful!
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Who is on this committee?
About what?
Leave me alone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Well?
All Vienna has heard that.
Do you hear me?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
What?
No, you didn't!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
That lady is back, sir.
Herr Salieri.
I'll call tomorrow.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Oh, Miss Price?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, why?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
What do you dream about?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I'm a werewolf.
I was dreaming again?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
But, David.
Anything.
I've left those pills for you.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Who is this girl?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Two weeks?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Yes.
Well, I like it here.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Hello.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Did you hear that?
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
It's moving.
Thanks a lot.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
What are you doing here?
Jack, are you really dead?
Dr. Hirsch?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Excuse me.  Yes?
Oh.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
No kidding?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Doesn't that come next?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well, what?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
What's this?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Yes, of course.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Mr. Dickson?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Well, I—
No. I won't.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
The lobby's half filled now.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
He's at a board meeting.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Why?
What did you do with it?
Yes.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Uhh, yeah it does.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Damn!
How many of them did he kill?
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
What you sayin' boy?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Where you boys going?
Thanks for the help.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Dammit!
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
Web died fighting?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
You are a charmer.
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
We're doing this for Ma.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Uncle Frank?
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Jesse, are you awake?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I beg your pardon?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Tennessee?
Did you order our houses burned down?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Yes?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Now let's have a drink.
I like that.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
There's only four of them...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Good.
Parker.
This is no game.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What the hell is that sound?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Dorsia's nice.
This is Dorsia?
It's a plain end, see? So?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Yes, darling?
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Can I help you?
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Don't come back.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
What...is...it?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Yes?
What is it?
Anywhere you want?
Jean? Sorbet?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Interesting.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Where are you?
So, what do you do?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
She's my...cousin.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Understandable.  Lime?
How old are you?
How well did you know him?
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Have you consulted a psychic?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I mean they want to get caught.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Is it over?
You don't wanna move, do you?
It's important.
They hack into people's programs?
You think I don't know that?
You look beautiful.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Milo?
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
You're living here?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
'Think I should buy some originals?
You did this -- overnight?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
It scales, don't you think?
You've been coming in early.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Ready for number three?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Did you wanna be alone?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I told Teddy about you.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Why?!
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
Bring it to the other location.
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
...You got my E-mail?
That kid's the great white hope.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
To my health.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
When do I begin?
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Why?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I have something to tell you.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
What is it now?
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
In due time.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
I'm proud of you.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
How long have I been here?
You are female?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
How curious ...
What are you trying to do to me?
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
An unholy trinity ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
I was about to throw in the towel.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Much better.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
And I suppose you're the knight.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Was I?
Because you always obey orders ...
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
You don't believe him?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Oh, hello ...
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
No, please! I beg you ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
John Steed.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Nice shot.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, we've got to talk.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
God, you're a slob.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Let's go.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Great bathing suit.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
So, Larry, how have you been?
You want to share it?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Feel free.
The end.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Mrs.?
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where the hell is he?
I'm not really hungry.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
How'd it go?
Who was that?
How 'bout this?
Hey, you guys...
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Is he...
Did you do it for Tim?
It doesn't go like that.
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Brian, look --
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Anything else?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Brian.
I work for city hall.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey.
I could use a date.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Then who wrote the report?
Your brother was a good man.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Yeah. Big fan.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Aren't you even curious?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Dad!
He just wants to --
Stephen, what are you doing here?
He treats you okay?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Who's this?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
Alderman Swayzak.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
What's to believe?
People.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
He gots to be did.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
Seconds and thirds, too.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You're in this up till ya neck.
You can walk away.  We both can.
De-la-croix.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
My tap shoes.
I would like to change your name.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Four minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Yep, you guessed it.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
You lost me.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
What is your problem?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Don't make me have to use this.
Hi, Mona.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
How's the food?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Regardless, he still is your father.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
I heard ya lady is wild.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
You leave something out?
I know I won't be your puppet.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
O'Grady.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I'll match any man with the sword.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Good gracious!  What is this?
I have no luggage.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Never.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He loves me, as I love you.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Bill Styles...
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
Why not?
You did Basic here?
And he'd been shot.
Where?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Right?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
I... I don't know...
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Is it the truth?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Something like that. You?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Buttfucks the cabin?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
We're fucked, I know --
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
Think it'll work?
For what?
Four --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
You're a good man, Hardy.
What are you doing out here?
Nah.
How?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He said what?
But you didn't see it, right?
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Tell him to shut up --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Someone stole my backpack.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
You were expecting me?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I have to leave. Tonight.
You get the eye?
Yeah.
Promise me you'll come back.
In so many words, yes.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Spooning the sherbet.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Karl.
You don't like it?
What did she say?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Jesus Christ.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Son?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
Let's get out of here.
I was drying out.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Oh. Oh.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
Do you love your father?
That really happened?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
It's enough isn't it?
What's this?
Say thank you.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Hello.
Sorry. You've lost me...
Yes. I know.
Hold on.
No.
So how long will you be in England?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
Is that everything?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I do. I want to very badly.
Give me some money.
What?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Excuse me?
I don't want to talk about it.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Some... What does that mean?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
What?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
Okay. Goodbye.
Whatever.
It's not mine.
No. What? No. I know.
My name's Sophia.
You have excellent English.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Hey.
More cough syrup?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Where's Ronnie?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Still makin' jokes?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Sorry.
You need some weed?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
This ain't gonna work.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Joyce can be nice.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Why the hell not?
I've continued working on the case!
It's very small.
It's illegal, Nick.
What's in the box?
Joyce?
What's that for?
You all right?
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
And I'm supposed to care?
We're in?
I still think you're a bastard.
Keep the change.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
Because I want you to tell me.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
With these?
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Let's go while there is still time.
One man.  He must be good.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
Show me something?
We have a lot in common.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
When?
You start.
How do I stop one?
Okay, but...
Not if it works.
How long you had these guys?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
How old am I?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
During the road test...
What if you change your mind?
My job is here.
Yeah?
The best.
I told you I'd come back.
This feels stupid.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
You know what I think?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Where are your folks?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Hi!
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
How do you do?
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Where are we going?
Dickhead?
Wait!  Wait!
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Why are you doing that?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Then forget it.
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
I was wrong!!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Where's he gone?
May I please be excused?
The what?
About clothing?
I certainly do!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I like her.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Adam?!
I'm really sorry!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Really?  Okay!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
Uh-huh.
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
When did we get it from them?
It's so small.
I don't think so.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Yes. He likes windows.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
You dial nine to get out.
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
How old are you?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Dad!
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Yes?
Good god.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
What's that noise?
Thirty -five years!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Hi, honey!
Get the presents and do the lights.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
You're serious, aren't you?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
He go back to the hotel?
What's it to you?!
Where are you going?
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What's wrong?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
What do you want from me?
Thank you. honey.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
Then don't talk about killing.
Nice guy. Who's he?
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Frank gone?
He's comin' back? What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Hello?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey? You like to walk.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
God, you scared me.
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Oh yeah?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Are you alright?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Here's to. An interesting experience.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
OK.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
Okay, thanks.
Who, me? Why should it?
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Jeffrey? Why?
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
NO.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Sandy?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
What did he bring him in for?
There's ways around that.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
You guys?
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
We're alive.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Absolutely not.
Nervous?
He isn't to be touched.
We do not want your tired and sick.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
So, what do we do now?
They were wearing masks.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
And the pennies?
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Oh my god!
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
What are you serious?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Worst day of my life, man.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hello? You there?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Has he now?
Just be natural, goddamit.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's really kind of hot.
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Dignan, calm down.
Why not?
What about them?
I'll just say it.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
She's from Cuba.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He's gone. He stole the car.
I wish I'd been there.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I'm not. But there's --
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What time did he say to be here?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
You're all clear.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
What are you talking about?
Dignan, it's too late.
How big is it?
No. I'm not.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Let them fight.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
How long are they going to hold him?
Why not?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Let's not even talk about it.
You OK, Bob?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
It's in the driveway.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Where'd she go?
Bob.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Did we get it?
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
The weed.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Not in that car you're not.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Just get in the car, Bob.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Dignan.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own cell?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
And what does that cover?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Where?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You a good pool player.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Let's talk about Conklin.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
What?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Had to be done.
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
Pamela Landy?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- what? --
I'll get the book.
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
But we were so careful.
So...
You drive.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Why is she trying to kill me?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
No... Jason... please...
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Looks like he's been detained.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
You're sure?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Did you?
Do we know what this says?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Does anyone know his politics?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
No, M'lord.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Stephen ready?
Rest, William.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Where is my son?
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You've been here before?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Peace is made is such ways.
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Who would do such a thing?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
You'd be surprised how often they are.
We're gonna be late again.
No.
I don't know... I don't remember.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
What does that mean for Evan?
There must be a way to fix this.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
I deserve a lot worse.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not if you remember my dad.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Where... where are my clothes?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Ha! Where's that?
Because you're... different.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Where are we going?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
And you are...?
Come on, go on...
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
What?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Lung cancer?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
Not an easy day to forget.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Put them on the table.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Did he give any reason?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Rick? Who's he?
How do you do?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I believe you have a message for him?
And that is?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
For the time being.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
This is the end of the chase.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
I have my orders.
Oh, how do you do?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Give me another.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Hello?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Boss, let's get out of here.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Do too little you'll die.
No.
What are you doing?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
No.  that was the last one.
This isn't working out.
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Need some help?
Thought you were going to bring her.
What happened to your pants?
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
That's all there is.
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
But you looked as if you liked it.
What's the *medical* explanation?
At least you were never lonely.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I'm okay--I can walk.
That's true.
That's a heavy sedation.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Is *your* father dead?
Did you grow up around here?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Uh... it's the end of October.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
First pregnancy?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
The Anti-Christ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Grifters...
So how'd you get caught?
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
Who's that?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You can't cheat an honest man.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I --
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
What about... The money?
That's not --
No.  What's my cut?
What the hell's his problem?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Look at you... You want to go.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
He was looking out for you.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Everyone's working an angle, right?
Sorry. I didn't know...
Your mess.
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
It's bad luck.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
We're working for the King.
Why?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Stand up.
Aces, Suits.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
So what do you want?
Still time.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You trust this Moonan guy?
What are you doing?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
The Indian rope-trick.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
Last hand.
I couldn't resist them.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Are you trying to read my palm?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
The door, Jack.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Why did you take the money?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
So how are you doing, dad?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
What happened?
I owe a lot of money.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
And your hand too.
How are you?
Did you solve your problems?
You've been avoiding me.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
What happened to Bella?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Where did you go to school?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Where's the magnet?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Ever?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
You are false data.
The only thing which exists is myself.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Veil nebula.
-- open circuit breakers --
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
You know what I think about, Talby?
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
We're running out of time, sir.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
What?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
How're ya doin', Max.
Why would I be pissed?
What are you doing here?
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
But I'm afraid of--
What're you looking for?
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
You're light a deuce.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
You didn't...
I know.
You're a thief?
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Lemme get my coat.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
With your help.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
None.
Who are you?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
No.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Right, the big one-oh.
Does this person have a name?
And why should she?
She tells you how I've been--
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
She was the one--
True, but--
For a change.
Thanks, miss.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Pick a song, Hawk.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
We've got to take this slow...
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Sunday, but...
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Ahh, sunshine.
But, mom!
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
I did it! I did it! We won!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Hi... what's going on here?
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Dea ex machina...
You have a request?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
How much longer is this gonna last?
Hey...
So... you just moved here?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Donnie?
That's alright... I understand.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Will you please talk to me?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
People aren't that simple.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
So how was school today?
Know what?
Oh, shit!
You're my only son...
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
That I did it again.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
How is that possible?
I can see him right now!
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Wicked.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Loretta, don't do that.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Amber...
What're you doin' here?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
This here's Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Wisconsin.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
So help me, Gladys.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
Here I am, Father.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Hey you!!
That was for you.
Oh no, I can't do it.
No, but I shot some ducks.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Send in the next girl. 
You no gotta no gun.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Give me that again!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
John loves the house.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Like this. 
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I want my man back.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
You've acquired a taste for this?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Oh, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Is he... dying then?
Want to come out?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
Yes!
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
Ohhh...
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Good morning, John.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
You did this for me?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Won't come out, eh?
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
Well...
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's your fantasy...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WHY?
What was she like?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
Do you believe I love you?
How do we know this is the way?
Is it night or day, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
No... we don't...
We're just not a very musical nation...
No.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Why should you care?
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What's wrong with making friends?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I... I... KILLED her...
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! In... Out...
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You mean we'd be dead?
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
Well, what else do we do?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
I came to find my grandfather.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
You're wasting your time.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Sh! Hurry!
Shut up!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
And something to sharpen them with?
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I remember.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
And I just liked you so much.
What's wrong with me?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Really?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
It's okay, really.
Really? Because --
I can't remember.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
You're sure? It's cold.
I'm not a stalker.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Take care.
I don't know.
It's pretty.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
What do you want to hear?
Well, I should probably get going.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
You should stay.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Such a beautiful view.
Oh?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Probably.
You said...
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
It's dark.
What if you stay this time?
So you'll call me, right?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
How's it going?
I might be making a mistake.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
So what's going on, Joel?
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yup.
And after that?
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
You made me have an abortion.
Well, where was Patrick?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Oh, hi.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Tell me about it.
You're political, then?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
What do you think?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
...do you copy?
Holy shit...
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
The containment, Second Containment...
What?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Coffee.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Does he know that?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
This is Weir.
What's the hold up?
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
That's a negative, Starck.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
I told you... She won't let you leave...
What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you?
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
It is now.  We're locked in.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
It tastes bad.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
I'll do it --
First time in a grav couch?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
What the hell is that?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
What are you doing here?
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're on fire!
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Apparently I can disappear.
Sweet.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
That's good. That's uh... good.
For science.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Easy, mon.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Are you still a virgin?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Jeff you have company!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Hey, Mike?
Oh. Hi.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Yo.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Who's that?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother is gonna shit.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
So what did you do?
You'll always remember your first time.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Not coming? What happened?
Sometime?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
What's that?
You look like you could still be in high school.
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
Are you all right?
Aren't your parents asleep?
No. That's okay.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Killed?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
How long do I have?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
That's good...
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
I have to go.
When does this thing stop?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
WELL? What are your plans?
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
What is this?
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
You realize...
What?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Stop it.
So, your husband ditched you?
They're right here.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
Scared?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Really?
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Max?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
'Eh, Chief?
Move it!
Yeah, maybe.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
You know you don't have to do this.
I admire your strength.
Did we make it?
What did we say about lying?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
What're you doing?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Excuse me, sir?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Good, good. Give them that.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
You don't think I'm good enough?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
There've been some calls.
Without me.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
...Don't you?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Name?
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Aren't you ever going back?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Whattaya mean?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
You don't know what you want.
What?
Oh no...
You're telling me.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Don't start, Farmer.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Evening, gorgeous.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
You know something, Harry?
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
That would be okay.
Pretty morning.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
That's me, Clifford.
But I want to. I'm trying!
How's it sound?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
You're not going anywhere!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
This whole thing is a joke!
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
It can't be as bad as that.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
What does it say?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Our decision. Together.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Are you having me on?
Do you really think I'm mad?
They just caught the man who did it.
Yes? And?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Professor Waldman.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Electricity.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
How is it you come to be here?
Ah. An explorer.
Your men are right to be afraid.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You want to leave?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
Oh, my God...
How come you're leaving?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
It sounded like Brenda.
You said we were special.
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
Holy shit...
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
What about Neddy?
Best over...
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
How much do I owe you?
I mean...
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
How many with you?
What was that?
What are you gonna do?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
What about Kate?
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Who's this?
How'd she die?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Why'd ya quit?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
To your family.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
I'm going for 'em!
Yeah.
-- see this, television!
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Whiskey!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Best in Mexico.
Do they have cable?
Do they have a waterbed?
How's it feel?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Where's the woman?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
I don't know, you just passed out.
My shit is together.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Straight up?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Fine by me, sir!
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Think I overplayed it?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
You'll think about my offer?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
O'Neil?
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Chances of recovery?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
No shortage of suspects.
"In Washington..."
I'd sure like to know who.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
Last time I didn't.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Do you, uh, know...
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Where's Audrey?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Think we can fit up in there?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Circuits are overloaded.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Are you okay?
My life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Wish me luck!
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
At ease men.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
What the hell is going on?!!?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
What do you mean?
But you don't?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
No, I'll kill you. .
As good as Hopkins?
...The digital conveyor.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Where are the miners?
They're still behind us...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
What?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
You're kidding. When for?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Theramin.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Do your best, Tommy...
Hold course, Laredo!
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
The army needs you.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Who is that!?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
A grand scheme?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
You must be very rich.
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Martha... what?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Not today.
But, you do come from a military family?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Then why are you teaching me...?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
You're out of your mind!
They can use their imaginations.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
You hear that?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
She's... young.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Hello? You there?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Why would I do that?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
Something shouldn't be there.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Ever shot anybody.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
What do you get out of this?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
It was in the Herald.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
I'm thinking of a movie.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Rough day on the set?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
You don't act like it?
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Hm?
Hello, Doris.
What a spectacular view.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake –-
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What day is it?
Where from?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
Roger.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Smokes?
If you get it back in one piece.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
What?!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Then why didn't they take it.
Candy?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
What'd you find up there?
Are you sure?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
You just shoot at something?
The ah... the radio's out.
The same day she supposedly went down.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Couldn't sleep.
The what?
What happened?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Call the Coastguard?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
What now?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
What happened?
Say what?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
It's a Noaa buoy.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
I thought you say Tuesday.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Give up?
About what?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Are you the one who left that note?
Yeah, right...
When did I say I hated you?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
So what should we do?
What is this?
Look, that's back when I hated you.
There's my dad with Joanie.
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
Ew, look at this...
That was truly pathetic.
Not really...
Just promise you'll do it.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
How about this one?
Give me all your money, bitch!
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Now are you going to get a regular job?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Look, we have to get these...
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
So, whaddya think?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
I dunno...
What about me? Am I not even here?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Five hundred.
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Oops! I dropped it!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Really? Can I see it?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Every guy has a type!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
So, why did you bring this along?
Yes, that would certainly do...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Aren't you going to get that?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
No, of course not.
What are you doing here?
What's up?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, well... me neither...
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Why would she be hiding from me?
I have no idea - I just want to...
What do you mean?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
You were contracted to work-
There is no reason for fear.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
It hasn't been that simple so far.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Very good indeed.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Finish your tour?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
...one shot...
Second death? Where?-
Have you got it?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
I am also liaison between these two.
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Do you love her?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Where is it?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Hello, Peter.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'll do it.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
So this is what you do, huh?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
That's quite a story.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
So far so good.
From where -- Neptune?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who?
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
And now you're going to eat it?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Does it have any favorites?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
She's moving!
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Now where are you going?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
... I thought it was the drug store.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's too bad.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Do you want this body?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
That is one speedy mutt.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I want you to have this. 
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Where's the Keymaster?
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
You talked to Gozer?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
For what purpose?
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Boy, that was a rough one.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
Do you believe in God?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Those are priceless sculptures.
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
Where is my family?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
So am I.
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
As soon as I can.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Serious stuff...
You brought the army into Rome.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
He's very realistic.
What about their philosophy lessons?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
Take your hands off me animal!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
I want to go home.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Do you?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
What's the matter?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
I'm meeting someone.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
-- really incredible --
Well, I want you to leave.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
But you might.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
The day after tomorrow?
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'm putting it on the top step.
Hello.
Benjamin?
What?
A single room or a double room?
Sir?
You don't?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Sit down, Benjamin.
What do you think?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
What is wrong with me?
Yes?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
What?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you understand what I said?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Thank you.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
You're not interested in art?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you want to hear it or not?
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Man, is this interesting.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
What was your major?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
I'm curious.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Did I say that?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Hello.
Yes?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
What's happening?
Have you a minute now?
He must be very nice.
You?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You were very different yesterday.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
And then --?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
There.
I'll not denounce you.
Do you understand?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Why?
Thank you, sir.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
For me?
I don't know.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
You dance splendidly.
Please -- please!
What's the matter?
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes, of course, -- money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Am I!
Tired?
What is this?
What?
What brown hands you have.
I understand you perfectly.
Miss Flaemm.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Insolent young cub!
What we want to know about is Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Yes --
What?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Shall I tell them again?
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Let us cancel the engagement.
Madam has slept well?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
You're discharged.
Yes, I know them --
How is the house?
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What do you want with her?
Pretty as a picture.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
No.
You ever hear about the oranges?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
What? Me?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Sure.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Why?
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
You're getting off the grift?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Let me see how you did that one.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Roy?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Her job.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
What?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Take a hike, you mean?
And hello to you, too.
I don't think I need it.
Don't I get any say in this?
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
You watch that mouth.
Sure. Let's get it over.
What?
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Why am I here?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Now you're joking, right?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
It's John, isn't it?
Look, they're staring right at us.
I have to pee.
Fuckin' A.
What's this?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Let the party begin.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Mommy!!!
What is it this time?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Come on!
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
You've created a monster.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home, sweet home.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Months?
And how were things?
Could have happened to anybody.
What's funny about that?
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Is Penelope in?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Man and boy.
College!
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
A hundred dollars!
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
How do you do?
What's the matter?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
Harold!
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Fish can't feel.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
The doctor.
Two hundred years old.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
No you don't.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
None.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Good Lord.
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You hope.
New lives begin!
Alice got married again.
You didn't even find that out?
Dead!
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I know.
Oh, Paul--
I don't really know.
Is Norbert still here?
That's why I'm crying.
Everything stays as it is!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I'm touched.
Coming.
Did you see him?
You were wonderful.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
What kind of a life is that?
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
You've got to fight from time to time.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
I just want to ask some questions.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Hello. You want some information?
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
The other girl is the star?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Up front?
You don't drink?
And your wife? Where's she?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Is that the way it was with you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Why do you say that?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
In G.R.? Why?
Where is she?
What are you doing here?
Yeah, sure.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Wes, do me a favor.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
You're talking about real excitement?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Fifty cents admission.
It's a short film.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Yes.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Check.
Because if you are...
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Do you dance?
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
What?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Oh.
Maude, I must speak to you.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Yes.
It's all right. It's organic.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
None at all?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Your classmates?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
How about to slit his throat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Frank.
She's done it.
What?
What do you mean?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Nonsense, I...
Where am I?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
You were burned by some organic acid.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
The freak in the gas mask --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
It's her choice --  She's human --
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Got tired of me?
-- should go back. Now!
Thank you.
Myers??? How's your arm?
What took you so long?
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Are you sure about this?
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
What about you?
Yes, I --
Christ!
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No time for argument.
We want the man who did this --
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
You bastard --
Julia.
No. God no.
Back from where?
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
This is what began it.
You would be. They tore me apart.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
So where's the harm?
Don't you care?
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
What's the problem?
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
Dead.
Not much fun, is it?
Drinking alone.
Well, isn't it?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Oh Christ.
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
What did you say?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Big house.
Kirsty.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
He's gone.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
You're not going?
I beg your pardon?
Can I lend you a hand?
Steve. Thank God you came.
What?
What are you doing?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
We can take your car.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Hey.
None.  Christ!
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Fuck off, Barry.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Why not?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Anna Moss.
Hey, Barry.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is there a difference?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Are you all right?
Rob --!
What is this.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Shit!
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What's the obvious stuff?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I don't know.
I suppose so.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Are you still in love with me?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Are you alright?
Who the fuck's Pig?
Me?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
Mission accomplished.
You know the difference.
More confident, maybe.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
So?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Is Ray going?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
It's a great song.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
So so.  Up and down.
Hello?  Anybody there?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I warned you.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Huh?
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Who is he?
I'd rather hear yours.
No.
You want me to front for you.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
He is older than I.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Not the same.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
I'm calling an attorney.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Who is it?
-Et lux perpetua-
Be quiet.
I did at that.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Does it change with me in the room?
I don't understand.
It is as you are.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Oh please.  Another one.
Not so scared.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Complete your inspection?
What is your position?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
We must talk.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Smith.  Carl Smith.
The last four.
How did you find me?
Run!
What's the point?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Do you know what this is?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
My condolences.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
You're a kind man to be sure.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
How do you mean?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
Too hot?
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How's business, Bruce?
How long would the interview take?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
What's this?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Done what?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
You've had a better offer, eh?
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Afraid? I should say not!
Allow me.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What now?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Never mind that. What's the story?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
She jumped out of the window.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
All the words you've got.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Well -- what is it?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Walter!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Open up there, will you!
She looks as though she's going to come to.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
So have we!
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
What went off?
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
A sight for sore eyes!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Did you get that, Hildy?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
How much do you make a week?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's he want?
The door was locked.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Is it peace in out time?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Tiny's home.
Who's your Daddy!
Can I help you with something?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Perfect.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Go around him.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Just back up.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Thank you.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
What should I do?
Get in... now!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Wydell.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hello, my little boy.
Say my name.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I am sleepy.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
I've moved on.
Hunh.
No.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Nice night.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Oh, and the sun block?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Flares?
I don't know. Something.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
No, why?
Yes.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I want to talk to you.
You bastard.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Here, I got it.
What's the matter? What happened?
They're fine.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Fifty per cent?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
You name it, we shoot it.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
Have a nice trip.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Yeah? What do you do now?
So why go to college?
Why did you do that?
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
What are you writing?
He's a gambler.
Well, he owns things.
You need the words?
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Where's Bert?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
That's what the game's all about.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
That is not now, human!
Are you all right?
Do you remember where you lived?
Yes.
Who is this?
Yes.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Shhh... don't talk.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
You and that damned garden.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
Hell of a night.
Bathroom?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Is that all he said?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Why?
Did you call the State Police?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What do you want?
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Pops!
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
What the hell is that?
Thanks, Pops.
Is my wife in the air?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Grey, you read me?
Where's it headed?
This is ridiculous.
A meteor?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
You scared the hell out of me.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Damn it!
I don't need it.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
And before here?
Marcus!  I did it!
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Schneider?
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
It would make me very happy.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Uh-huh.
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
But what are you doing here?
Well, what was left of him.
...you did it.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
You did!!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
How did you she was a Nazi?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
This is intolerable!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Nice landing.
This is intolerable!
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Get that camel out of the way!
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
Interested in local curios?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
What do you mean -- how?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What about the future?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
What is it...?
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I get it!
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
Who?
I know...it sounds insane.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Of course you do!
I'll tell you what to say.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
I wouldn't say that.
You are CRAZY!
Sue them.
Now what.
You mean...just leave.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Beautiful!
You're beautiful..
Where is she staying?
What happened?
Mind your own business.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
I feel like an idiot.
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
What is it, your charm?
What Happened?
Come on, she's getting away.
One of your instincts?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
haka xuki.
Are you alright?
He aready made the deal..
This may hurt.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
They have stolen state property.
Me.
That crazy guy?
...Foreign service.
Your memory.
It may have been affected.
You may not remember things.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Now you know what I know.
What did you say?
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
Blake said that?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Can I help?
Promise you what?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Who do you work for?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
He didn't.
You know where he went?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Where what?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What happened?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Now what?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I knew it. I told him.
Riuji?
What could you find in this place?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Right there.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What's new?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
Yeah.
We gotta hook up.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I don't know what he was thinking.
What was that about?
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
You're exaggerating!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
What the hell are you doing?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
That computer has everything...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Yeah?
Why?
Lowell?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
What's wrong?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Jeffrey Wigand...
I got perspective.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Yeah.
So, is everything okay?
Thank you for saying that...
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Did I get you up?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
I know what I have to know.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
How much would I get paid?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Good. But Jeff...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
Just give me an example...
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form!
Hello.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jail?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Excuse me?
That's his lawyer.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Why in God's name would I want...?
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
I'm happy for you, pal.
Is she Asian?
I have it.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Marylin! What have I done?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
How do you know?
No.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
What is it you're after, Miles?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
To victory.
Screw you, asswipe!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
From a -- girlfriend.
Hmmm...
We're damaged goods.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I have a surprise for you.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Comfy!
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Hello Marylin.
We are. And it's winding down.
Is this a lover?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Wow.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Is this Ming?
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Herb wants to see me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
What?!
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Where does that leave us?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Nothing?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Berry spoons.
Extinguish?
Hi, Sweetie.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
How is she?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Where are you taking me?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I knocked several times.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Are you going to see him?
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
You talk as if—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
All right, let it go.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Who are you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Where is the shower?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
King—King Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Here. Eat your head off.
Thought you were hungry!
Sure.
What are you thinking about?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Carrots.
You think it's simple, huh?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What're you going to do?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Eat a carrot.
Any luck?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
The old man's screwy!
Mr. Gordon—
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
I'd put you there myself.
You!
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
What do you reckon that's for?
You send telegrams here?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Yeah.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You love them, don't you?
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Right.
And Oswald?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Are we going away, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
...you heard echoes.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
No.
Let me show you his picture. 
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Hi.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
For sexual purposes?
Oh no!... How bad?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Post Office.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
How much more?
You have other information?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Why were you with him?
How'd you know where he was?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
You got a good lawyer?
She sound scared?
Can I have a word with you?
I'm not a loser.
Help us do what?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
What did they want to know?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Somebody loan it to you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Really?
Well, hello.
Catching a movie.
Why?
How old's Annette?
He was here?
I called you last night.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
You do that?
Did you do it that night?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
You're rationalizing.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
Where's the rest of it?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
We're partners.
Where're you going?
Who's side are you on?
If I don't cooperate?
Oh, Miss Brown?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
You didn't count it?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
What did you do after that?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
He said he didn't know about it.
You think I'm kidding?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
I understand woman, damn!
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Who?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Where at?
What for?
You okay?
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Did you ever go I one?
I lived there for about nine months.
Is it dead?
Please.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
We're leaving now!
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
What are you doin'?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
What's your relationship?
She believed you?
It's Louis.
You couldn't just hit her?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
They don't have your winning personality.
Yeah.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
It's in my bag.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Where is it?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
You sure?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Well, how do I look?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Are you all right?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Grass never did that to me.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
You're hurting me!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Don't go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
He say what they looked like?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Who?
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you doing?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
I'm not cold.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but for what?
I must have been out of my head.
What do you mean you can see?
Is that the one who died?
I'm going home.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
We're at Della's.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
What'd the doctor say?
I can't do it.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
I know.
He said you didn't have one.
Who else were you expecting?
I want to know. You tell me!
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
WHO ARE YOU?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I think I'm falling asleep.
I would have stayed there if I could.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
He's burning up.
Please come quietly.
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I have some ice from the machine.
Is he all right?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
He's not part of the program.
Can we blow it with just two?
Minimal.
Bomb?
Sergeant!
Okay that hurt.
Where the hell were you?!!
Everyone okay?
I'll need system four converters.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
Get them in the lab!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Sergeant!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Rizzo, pull away!
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
That's really funny.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Yuck.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
I'm missing two!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're so bossy.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Almost done.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em we made it!
I missed you too.
Leave him behind!
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it?
That's it! Radio in for help!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's trying to sink us!
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
How come you have to tell them that?
Colorful, isn't he?
Now tell me something I don't know.
Only 24 hours!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What? What?!
He ate a car?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Think she might've run out on you?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You wanna call it a night after here?
Look at him take it!
You love sharks?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Over there!
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
So, what do you think we should do?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Charisma?
Okay, cool.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
I don't like Katrina.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
I still have your virginity!
Wait, let me take that.
I try really hard, actually...
Mine too.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Oh, God...
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
No.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Like what?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
You should try Adderall.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Please stop now.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this Juno?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
You're not listening to me.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Touche.
Aw, please Junebug?
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
We're actually, finally doing this?
No.
Hi, I'm Adele.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Is it hard to learn?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
What's this?
Hold still.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Shush, Adele.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This the book your writing?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie.
Who said he's my good buddy?
What's that?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
What about you?
Bri'.
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
You were plenty hot.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
His Parole Officer.
...Diebold?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
You're clean.
Shit.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
It is right.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I hate this game.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
What?
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Do you like kissing me?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
You know what I want to do?
Why?
Telly is at Steven's?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sorry.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Your a real philosopher.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Telly says was up.
Did you bleed?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
What happened?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
No. I was just kidding.
Hi mom.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Where does everyone sleep?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Slow.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
No.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
You're a lying bastard!
You want me to what?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
No shit!
You still having a problem with this?
How is she?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
And -- what path is that?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Why her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
Hello.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Nope.  Nothing.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
What is it?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Come here.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
How long has she been dead?
What about prints?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I'm busy right now.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
Where were you last night?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
It's a good play, but risky.
About what?
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
We need your help.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You mean like in the steam room?
No.
I know you didn't
Why?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It was.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm hungry.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
Peter, you have to admit--
Peter...
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Peter...
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Because I know what it says.
You beat him.
I'm not nervous.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I lied.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
In the Arctic ice.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
I cannot reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Can she be forced?
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
She can see the Beast!
Each to his fate.
Let me comfort you.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Once is enough, thank you.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
You!
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
My heart stays here.
Sugarballs?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Food for crows.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He is the King.
It's a lie!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A fine match.
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
She has the power of vision.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
You had a son.
You see?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You will come with me.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
...You moved too, didn't you?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Take...
130... 140...
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Poor darling, and then?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Yes?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...OK... Good.
Is he still alive?
What is it?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Are you a preacher?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Yes?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Anything?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Most certainly.
Red flag, man.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Are you firing me?
Where?
You're walking to California?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Tom Joad?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Good morning.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Coffee?
Sparkling apple cider?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Sarah -- with an H?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Do you want to fuck now?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
This is the home of an angel.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera...
Me neither.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
What do you mean?
How are you doing?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Please!
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Will you lighten up, please?
You know I love you... yeah?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been?
Don't hit me.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I'm sorry, but --
You're hitting on me?
So everything you just said --
What did you see when you entered the house?
What's going on?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You can't go home!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
I'm her sister.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Josh proposed!
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Why?
She's not!
The what?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Neither.
I don't know --
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Of course.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
That's not entirely --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You go where?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
You look -- nice.
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Is it a Kappa?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Why?!
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We go out, smash 'em now?
You go to lady now?
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
Damn you!
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No, wait... please... listen...
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
You be our guest, Jack.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Damn them!
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
We must follow that bird.
This is ogre's magic.
Worse than the battlefield.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Good.
Certainly understandable.
I should hope not!
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
God's blessing.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
I was with the Princess.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
These for me?
But you did... you did!
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
He did run?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Tis the truth.
My lady mocks me.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
I'm afraid it may storm.
No!  I won't let it happen...
What?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
What's the matter?
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Step lively now!
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Praise be to God.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Simple as that, eh?
In a dream.
Marco!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
I put him to work.
I had them in my pocket.
You're a good girl.
Where's your dad?
He's a freak.
I might not stay, anyway.
Huh?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
We're not gonna do anything.
Where are you?!
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He's at work while I'm here.
He won't leave my room.
Are you guys' friends?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
That would take weeks.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe...?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Hello?
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Are you totally insane?!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I hate turkey.
It bugs me.
I don't know.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where are you going?
You're too fucking late.
You can't make me do a thing.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'm not even listening.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
What would you be doing now?
Sun glasses?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
God, you look like crap, George.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
It makes me sad.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
It's been a while.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
What the fuck?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
We've eaten.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You never really trusted me.
Do it now!
You could keep it and rent it out?
He's a big one.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Why not?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
I got it... boss.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
I've never seen you in here before.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
That's some long green.
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
No, man. I want you to have it.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
What does that mean?
What's up, Ray?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You drew this?!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Crawfords.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
What the hell are you doing?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
What'd you say?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
You ever done time before?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
Where am I at, man?
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
They gave me life, mama.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Apparently, your sister died.
Appreciate it.
Who?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
I'll call her later.
How did you see me?
What is it?
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I mean... tough break.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
No. This can't be happening.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Thanks.
Hey...
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
There's our man.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
You sure you're down with this?
Schnapps...
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Hey.
Valerie?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Yes. What is rent?
That just hurt a lot.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
Answer the question!
That's better.  How do you want us?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
That was a great shot you made.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Why did you do that??!!
Where do you live, Mary?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
When do you go up?
What's wrong, Available?
Well then...?
Sad? What made you sad?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
And now?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
Of course.
Why show me?
Why tell me?
What're you going to do?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I -- I can't.
Will you take me with you?
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
What kind of jewel is this?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
You okay, man?
I'm, okay... You okay?
No.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
Okay...
What's he do?
Pornos.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you my man?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
When he went to work, right.
I want to see him.
Who is this man?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Where's Alice?
Good book, huh?
I had a dream about you last night...
What's that? Another tape?
So?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Give that a try.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Why haven't you called me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Sheila...
Cable from Gainsford.
What about those men we met this morning?
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Uh-huh.
I see.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Have I?
Certainly not.
Yes.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Think of it! In times like these.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
When was all this?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No porters here!!
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Oh, immediately.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Are you taking me?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Hurray!
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Maria?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
What do you suggest?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I'm so glad.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
What is it?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
No. just peace on Earth.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
You think we're nuts.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
You do?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
What?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Looks like a train ticket.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
He's here to help!?
What are you doing?
Would you call this a code 100?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
in case I need it?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
When?
Yeah ... ?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Nowhere.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Did he say where?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
And they're buying it?
Actually, I don't know...
He's here.
Please, I want to go back...
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
John?  What is it?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You the sentry?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
You the only sentry?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You can't run --
John --
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
What?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Confirm with trig and image.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She spoke to me.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Just go to the beginning!
Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, play it back...
It's a little late for that.
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Who made you do this?
Something wrong?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I believe in that system...
You said they're destroyed.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
I understand.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
It's the same prevision.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Precog Deja Vu...
So there is a way to fool the system?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Can't they shut that off?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Howard --
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
I don't have any sugar either.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
They've never been separated before.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Not on me, sir.
Women?
It's on West Broadway.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
Is he cute?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
No.
Uncle Bobby?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I -- I -- I... Don't...
What's up? Jess ready?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
So, when's the drop.
What's that?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
How so?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Yeah?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
We look good this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
I don't know.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
They didn't say an address?
How'd they know who you were?
You know this guy?
He woulda told us right?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What are you doing.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
All the more reason.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You did?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
How much is what?
Yes?
Ow, shit...
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Yeah.
Nah, man...
Yeah.
So you're our own private guy?
A lot of Persians?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Keys.
I get it.
Don't worry. I get it.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Edinburgh.
Dip?
I'll get it.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Why?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
Don't con me.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
What the hell for, man?
Where am I gonna start?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Make it plain.
Could we sit down someplace?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Dear heart, where are you?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
Is she hooking?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Head nigger in charge?
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
What am I doing here?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's the boss?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Drive.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
Who's he?
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[What do you mean?]
[And I had my men ready.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
So what's wrong?
Yeah, right...
Creasy?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Did you like school, Creasy?
What are you doing?
It hurts.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
You feel sorry for the husband?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Did you used to?
You're late.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Be a swimmer.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Jordan!
Creasy... Wait.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
All right, I'll see you!
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Ufa!
Ah?
What they say?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You come up here often?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
What?
Are you kidding?
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Tommy...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
What are you going to do with him?
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Y'all just act natural.
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Any time. Whenever we want.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
I have a tent to myself.
We think the same way.
Wait a second...
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
We stand behind all our work.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
But I'm married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What's the story?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
No, never in the slightest.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Did you get it, too?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
How much money do you get?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What John Doe?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Hurry up, Pop.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Duets? But can we trust him?
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Has he been here?
Where's Connell?
Baseball?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
St-rike!
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
I trust him.
Sure.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Flowers.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
No shit! He's good!
Apartment 306.
What's the line?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Manual or automatic?
Who are you again?
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
It rarely has to be done.
What's the point of this?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You got a girlfriend?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
You think you can learn, McCall?
You know the ten commandments?
To save lives.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
To run last?
They need to run first and second?
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's got the girl.
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Hey.
Maybe you should be.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
It's already started.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
You like this place?
Korda escaped.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
...the hell are you talking about?
The hell I am!
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Roper.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
And a car.
There are two million people in there with you.
It's okay.
She said I have a son...
Why --
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Do you believe in miracles?
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
What's happening?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
You are not a God.
The new world.
Dream?!
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
What's her name?
The woman you're stuck on.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Won't be time if he gets access --
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Who did he digitize?
What did he tell you?
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
Insurance?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
You said we were on the same programming team.
But I don't know anything about programming.
But you were with me.
Why not?
It was just there.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Connect to public access.
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
So how can we get to it?
I heard that!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I see... a fox
That's the only way to the Monolith...
Two thirty three a.m.
... Not bad.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
I'm outta here.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
The deal's too good, Frankie
Well...
Inside, they were talking of you.
No. They envy you.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Something came up.
Have you thought about this?
You could have stopped him.
Charlie?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
We'll figure out something.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
You're getting' 10 cc's
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
This business is about taking risks.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Not stupid. Fat.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
The terms will be mine.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yes?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
What's the maximum safe dose?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
I might wake up.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Where'd he go??
Stu...LOOK!
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
... What are they all doing there?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
It was?
But it *isn't*?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Tell me why!
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
What dame?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Okay. You don't mind?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
My first name's--Clarissa.
The war's on!
What!
Sam Foley--dead!
Dinner, Hubert.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Oh--oh.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*But you never asked me*!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
I did. What about it?
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Well--goodnight.
Ah, now, that's better.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
What is it?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go ahead--punch.
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Lena.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Already? All these letters?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
What are you going to do?
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Sure.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Chick--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
You want to see me, Senator?
No?
Well--me, too!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
What do you think?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Mr. President...
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Since he was born.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
No. Are you?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are these the articles?
But they did take place?
Oh, thank you!
You fainted.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Have you seen the papers?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Now, what do you see?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
You said I was a lady in distress.
What did you mean by that?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Uh-huh.
You're a fool, Babe.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
With pay!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
That's the rub.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Relatives of old man Semple.
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Hang up.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
No.
A what?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
No, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Please!
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
But you do therapy?
I have eighteen more minutes!
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
What?
No?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's wrong with her?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And he's where?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is it something you've heard about me?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Hello?
Sofie...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Oh.
In maybe three or four issues.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Well, there's Lily.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
A doll?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The sun turning black.
No women allowed.
No?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Something like that.
I'm not?
Is he supposed to look like that?
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Tough break.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
I knew you'd know.
Do I?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
We didn't think this through very well.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
No one will believe us.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Superheroes.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Hi.
Who's the artist?
Hi.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
It's me.
You drink too much.
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
This place is built like a fortress.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Maybe she's right.
Firepower costs money.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
Jeffrey!
It is?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Hi.
This is bad.
Are you sure he's still lives here?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Oh no.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know, sire.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Hello there, Picart.
When did it start?
Why didn't you wake me then?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Thank you.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
I know of no better time.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Were you in love with him?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were they pretty?
She must have been in love with you.
Separate bedrooms?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Why did you give it to him?
What?
How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Is he alone?
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Stretch it out.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No I'm not.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
So.
You better stop running from that girl.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I will.  When can I come visit?
You want us to give you a ride?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Here I come!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
You coming in?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You see that?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
What it say?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Hey.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
William.
You too big.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Mr. Nasty time?
Elroy, what happen?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
All right, I'll do it.
Amtrack?
'S okay. What do you think?
Who did?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
You get another chance in ten minutes.
No.
Is that something precious?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
But...
We have to hurry.
Ready?
Lynn!
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
It's a twenty.
Cover your mouth.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Oh, Jesus ...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
Thanks for the shine.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You have, huh?
You got this under control?
Come Back.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Where's your Mom?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Just went?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Twenty-five wives!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Tell me a story, John.
Pearl! You ain't --
It's all here.
To see Dad?
I'm hungry, John.
Don't you hurt her!
John, where's your folks?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
John's bad.
About our secrets.
Why, pray tell?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Them kids is yours?
What do you want?
What are you after them for?
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
How can you tell?
It's just a stupid cat.
What the hell's going on!?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Okay?
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Hello?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
How you plan to do that?
What!?
Meanwhile...?
You used me, daddy!
He's dangerous.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Did you sleep?
Right home after.
You okay?
I must be going nuts...
Okay... You need anything, just call.
What's with the bars?
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
What you mean 'all at once'?
Rod says the sweetest things.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
No more fights?
When did you have a nightmare?
Bring me forty-five back.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
An evening gown.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
We don't like Razinin.
That must be the one!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Good evening, Gaston.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Is this satisfactory?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Yes, Leon...
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
Comrade Buljanoff...
How much does this cost?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Bad news?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
What's that?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Yes!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Love to.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Suppress it.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
And what is your profession?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Was that talkative?
Thank you.
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I wish they had never met.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
What shall we get? The news!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Did you win?
Those newspaper people?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
What did he say?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
You leave me no choice.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Good morning, Comrade.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Your Highness.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
How's the job coming, Bob?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
How much do you need?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I understand that, sir.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
The country's loving it.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
That was civil war.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, why not?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Just do what I say, Bob.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Where are they?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Sir?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
We took his system out.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Who we working for?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Yes.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Uh, wait ...
How many?
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
But it was all we had.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
What's in there?
Proud?
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
How'd you know I was here.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
How come're you doin that?
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
You're discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Who's he in trouble with then?
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
But you don't believe it.
What about yours?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yessir. It was punched out.
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
No.
No.
Big talk.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know where the money is.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Yessir?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
Hello?
Huh? What is...
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
I don't know.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
All right.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
...What time do you go to bed.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
You already have the tent?
What kind of tent?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
One room, one night.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
...I'm wondering...
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Half.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Took me about three hours.
What did you do?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Pot metal?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Don't jack with me.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Sheriff, I don't...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...plenty
Did you send anyone out there?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
A woman can write a check.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
You're lying!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Any idea where it is?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Great. Good. Content...
Do you know who I am?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
No... what about your sister?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
That's very kind of you.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
You never gave us a chance...
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
George...
So, call me when you --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What was that?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...well, then you ain't got much.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Uh-huh.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
So why'd you come to L.A.?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Doctor David Ravell.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
You should have a little faith in people.
...this is your sweater, right?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Like what?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
That is so right.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
How'd they describe her?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Hmm?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
What did you say?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
You can't do this -
Hang on there -
...Pete?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Yeah, look at me.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Helluva idea.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
But...
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
...Yeah?
Daddy!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
Who gave you this idea?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want to fly, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is your brother a flyer?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
What the fuck is funny about this?
He said open it.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Are you okay?
The walls are steel, right?
Where did you get this clown?
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
She's never coming out.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Watch your mouth.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Shoulda got an apartment.
He's going down.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
I'm sorry.
Lemme see that rifle son...
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
So... we understand each other Judge?
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
You got it. Berkeley?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
You want me to put a man on it?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
You were. infantry right?
We appreciate your help with this.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
I saw... but...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Huh?
You alright?
Motherfuckers...
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Ain't no one seen him.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Excuse me?
I know that.
Of course, I do.
We did.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Shall we proceed?
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Thank you.
Very well, let us move on to...
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Is it?
These four wagons must be his.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Don't touch him.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Don't worry.
That bad?
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
It's gorgeous!
No-I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Because you promised.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I don't get it.
God, that's fine.
What?
Not yet...how much further is it?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I'm not climbing that.
It's funny, all right.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Can I have another one?
Why, then, things should be fine.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Leave me alone!
My God!
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
No!  You gave your word!
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Did he speak?
That would hardly be proper.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
What?
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Move!
I can get you out of here.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Just do it quickly.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
On what?
No.
Jack!
You've seen the Black Pearl?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
How long do you leave him in there?
Wheelchair accessible.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
... plastic.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Do you think she loves him?
Then you still love me?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Yeah?  So what?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What are you going to do?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You're afraid of him.
What's it smell like?
Like Crazy Glue?
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
You don't know?
We don't have time for hysterics.
Why do we need it?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Susan!
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Do you have something to bring me down?
What's wrong?
No cheese.
You made this out of my hair?
Who is he?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
We've got to get the nanobot.
You!  I remember you!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
What in the hell?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
I'm not going!
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
What is this person doing here?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yeah!
Oh, is that so?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
It has been alleged - yes—
And live on your salary, I suppose?
No?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
That's a canary, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Thanks, thanks.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
My mistake - she's glaring.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
What could I be?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Hey, Gallagher!
What did he want?
What other girl—?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I—
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
It's haunted just the same.
Mary Sue?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
And they won't be able to tell?
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Where'd you get this?
Like a drum.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Oh yeah.
Sure is pretty.
I don't believe it.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
What happened?
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know about the fire?
God, David. Just give it to me!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
No way.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Jen, listen ...
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
What do you mean?
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
What's wrong?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
No. She really liked you.
Are you sure?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Keeps going ...
Mmmmgh.
So what's it like?
How?
Real rain?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Don't get upset.
BUD.
I want a word with you ...
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Yeah ...
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's beautiful.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
This is Barry.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
...yes I'm still on hold...
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's not cool?
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What's all this pudding?
Hey. What are you doing?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Me?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
-- you said you did.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hello?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Business is good, you're busy?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
What do you do with all this pudding?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
....yeah....
No I didn't say that.
Is everything ok?
What did he want?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Oh that's great.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
That was good.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Have a good trip.
Where you married?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Where do you have to go?
I'm sorry.
Ok.
Why?
On my knife.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
The police are on their way.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
How many sisters do you have?
How's business?
What's up?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I need to talk to you for a second.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes I am.
Seven o'clock.
What's the problem?
What did you say?
Put him through.
Yeah.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Has he hurt you?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
I have a proposition.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Of course.
And --?
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
He'll do no such thing.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
Yes?
Here it is; the last chapter.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Good God, Marquise --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
How was I to know, my darling?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Louis
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
This picture--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Thank you for your time
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He lied to me
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Not for me.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Oh Christ...
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Fuck you--
He'll destroy us.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Jesus Christ --
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
May I help you?
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
This is an abomination There's no music and--
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I think you better sit down
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
He's Christ?
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You're a good sport, lady.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Answer me when I talk to you.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
How do you know? You know her that good?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
See? That's all there was to it.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Yeah. At night.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Now take the rest off.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
That he's got a pretty face.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
Jeff -- huh?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Did you ever own a saw?
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Jefferies.
I'll send you some comic books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I can't. The police have it by now.
I predicted it.
That's abnormal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's only perfect.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
You're never going to marry?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Huh?
I wonder.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Who's Thorwald?
Anything else bothering you?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Maybe she died.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
What doesn't?
I have the whole weekend off.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
I hate funny exit lines.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Well?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
L. B. Jefferies.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Meaning me?
Machismo?
Sure.  It's fine.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
Mother--
You thought I was Mom?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
We don't have time.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You're absolutely right!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Excuse us a minute?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
Hi.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Jim!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Plato?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Here.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I shot at one of them.
What?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Do I have to spell it out?
No.
If he could--
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Where's Dawson High School?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
No--I was just--maybe--
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Why did you do that?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I never felt so clean before.
No!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Do you think your father means that?
That one?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants the money.
Toys for... adults?
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
No --
No, c'mon --
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Ashley, Jesus --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
NO!
...the truck driver...
You motherfucker.
Gabriel!
They've never done a robbery?
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I love you, Nick...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
He says he wants it now.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
I saved your life.
No --
But I never said Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
No, you can't --
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What's her middle name?
What'd they call her in high school?
Be more specific.
We walked the place for a week.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Do I get a country-western name?
You got one hour.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No way.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Get in the CAR!
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
What about the Powwow Safe?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
You want that for here or to go?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
GUARD! GUARD!
Do what?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
You fuckin' wish.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
What?
But what is this?
What?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Just hold on buddy boy.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Give me this fucking thing.
You gonna put it away?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
What for?
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
What're you talkin' about?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
What happened?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
No real people?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what is it?
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Who shot who?
Tell them to come on in.
It doesn't matter who they are.
Yes, ma'am.
Our kind of women?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Like what?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
So that was why she tried to run away.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
Thanks for taking over.
I -- lost something.
Who's Lednov?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
In a fight?
At the ranch maybe?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Yeah, it does.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Yeah, how did you know?
You're not bein' quite fair.
You're not bein' quite fair.
It isn't that --
You got no business snoopin' around --
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Even women?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
We don't want to go there.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Would you like to learn them?
Good night, Miss Wells.
And that's tough, isn't it?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I won't let you do it.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Really? That's amazing.
Thanks.
Shhh... It's okay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Let's get outta here.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
He's here.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Let her go, Cin.
How about these buns?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop! --
Noooo!!!
Father!
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Oh.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I got it!
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Let me help you.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
What the hell?!
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Hello Dwight.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Alright... I might need your help.
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
"Ray!"
"Ray!"
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
Sorry, ma'am.
In here, Mom...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Who wants fruit salad?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
It's him!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs... Sutphin?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Are we leaving?
I'll give you fifty cents.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You can't tell.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
How much does she want?
I'll give you a check.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
She's a pretty good sort.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
What were you talking about?
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Could you find him?
Let her know what?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I was a great dancer...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Yes.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Ann?
That was quick.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes.
No, not really.
You play an instrument?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
Mother, father, sister.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Do you want them?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Yes.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
To you?
This is just... so...
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
No.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
Her name was Elizabeth.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Subtlety?
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Like maybe a big part?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Why are you ashamed?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Why?
Where did you go when you left here?
Bastard...
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
What do you mean, like physically?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
That you are under no obligation to me?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
What?
And what?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
No!
He wouldn't do that.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Thank you.
Do I know you?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't give you my address?
Doing what?
You just want to ask me questions?
How do we start?
Do you like the way I look?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Hello.
No.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Not today. I've got other plans.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
John Millaney.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Student?
Not for three-fifty.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're the one who found the bodies?
You knew these people?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Well? Supper at my place?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Want me to breathe deeply?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
About Brad's family?
Introduce yourselves.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
But...how?
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'll leave you young things to it.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
I'd forgotten.
Could you tell us a little about it?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
You shouldn't have said that.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
BRAD!
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
This could be worse than the old series.
And none of them worked?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Two years ago, buddy.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Oh, that's tasty.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Yeah. Tight.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Where were you?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Where is Stephanie?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nice shot.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
With Maya.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What's it look like to you?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
What the fuck!
Look at this!
You broke some.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You want to join us?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Ken.
That was big of him.
How much skin and stem contact?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Should we get dessert?
Where's Jack?
Huh.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
No.
A hair.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I don't want you to die.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Pharmacy crowded?
How can you say that?
Do you feel comforted?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They're on the roof.
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
I can feel air.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
These are D's; I need double A's.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
And three weeks.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
...Gotta go...
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
McKendrick's men got him.
Kate?
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Paden sends his best.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
I'll see you around.
Who?
That's a lie.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
You can't do this.
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
Why him?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Hello, Cobb.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
What makes you say that?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
You're not renewing my contract.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Really?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
No, I'm okay.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How will you do our love scenes?
You can't.
There's... a wall between you --
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You have to see her.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Hi, Dad.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What now, Sayer?
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Would you like me to read?
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
What if it catches on fire?
Good morning, Simone.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Wow. They called you their son.
Why did you leave me?
I forgot your name.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Yes?
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I wish I were somewhere else.
And you know what else?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Yes, Cole?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
I don't know how else to look--
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Could take a little while, though.
See?
Fuck you.
Witch.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Gene.
Sounds familiar.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Well, there goes our record deal.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
You'll be back.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Ow!
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
So?
Suzie --
Wait a minute --
I almost thought for a second...
Second verse!
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And that makes you look like a squid?
Pretty, ain't they?
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
No reception out here.
What are you doing?!
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Sure thing, killer.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Where'd he go?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Kate McConnell.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
So tell me about yourself.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I'm proud of you.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
My very words.
Why are you stopping?
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit?
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
What about the sheriff's task force?
How bad?
Did he give you his name?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
That's probably him now...
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
Here. Sit.   Please.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
...When did you know all this?
...Yeah, fifty-three.
I wouldn't go that far.
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
... Jesus... what for?
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Shoot.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You'll end up like me.
What happened to Gibarian?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Listen --
No.  There's no behavior modification.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Is there anybody else here?
How long can you go without sleep?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Kelvin, you awake?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
What happened?
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
You want to fuck her?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You're better when you take them.
What do you remember?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it a planet?
You still don't believe in God?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I like that too.
What's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Do you want to stay here?
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
No.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You're lying.
I wish you wouldn't.
What are you taking?
He won't do it.
Gibarian was under enormous --
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Looks a little constipated to me.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I'm supposed to call in.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
What about Neil?
You asked.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Open the door, will you?
You put me life in danger.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I do care about you!
Yeah.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Where?
Claire...
What a memory.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
I like your coat.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
My ass if falling.
Hey.  The neighbors.
I'd identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you do tonight?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
What about when she identifies him?!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
What're we having?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Nice threads Dad.
What, want a glass?
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Lizzy!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Yeah--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
I hate--
My my.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
You should write that one down.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
You'd feel what?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Poison emergency.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Do you... live around here?
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Come on!
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
How did he get over there?
Then we're all in on it?
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105-353.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
You are being rude again.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
You were saying --?
Jawohl?
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Grable, not Gable!
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Betty! Betty!
Not yet.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
You taking Dunbar?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
I'll kill you for that!
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Is it all right if we smell it?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Data?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
That's where he's going.
Is she still angry?
I get it. I get it.
What?
Data, this isn't the time.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Can I?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
We don't have a tractor beam.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Maybe they're not out there.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor Soran?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The Nexus.
It looks like we're too late.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Aye sir, coding now.
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Mr. Scott...
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Why would you do this...?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
We are clear and free to navigate.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Yours...?!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Genesis, I want it.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Yes, I was...
But -- why?
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Bones!...
What I have done, I had to do.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Well done, Commander.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's the Genesis Wave!
He's on a build up to detonation!
I didn't expect anything.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Departing dark side, Regula.
Yours... is... the superior...
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
On screen.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Carol Marcus --
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Affirmative, Admiral.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
May I speak, sir?
I did not think so.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Indeterminate life signs.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
How?
That was close --
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
He's very human.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
You lied.
I do not understand the final question...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It doesn't look all that different.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Hi... Busy?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Find it?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
You mean man...
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Do you trust me?
You're upset about losing the whales.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
It's true... what you said...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You tricked me.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Thank you, Admiral.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Ready sir.
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Hi.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
A perfect moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Do machines ever play?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Why not...?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Very funny...
She's stabilizing.
Incomplete, I might add.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
You're not finished here?
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
That's your expert opinion?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
Who is it?
Worf, you must hurry...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Counselor?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Come in.  Hi.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
It's Cochrane.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
You actually performed surgery...?
Is it Japanese?
Do you know what this is, Data?
No. I will not betray my friends.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Who are you?
Where?
This must be it.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Entering the upper ionospere...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
ATR setting...
Main bus...
Cochrane?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
You're leaving, aren't you?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Why?
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Return to our own time?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Are you alright?
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Good luck, Captain.
Figures.
Specifically of...?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Retire.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Me?
Spock, I'm really tired...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
Are you dining on worms?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Her own father...?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Trouble?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
NO WAY!
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know where you are?
Why?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Remember him?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
To new worlds...
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
A bit less florid, Data.
What do you imagine this is?
Ready, Captain.
Yes.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
You have a red shirt.
Why?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
What is our approximate distance?
It's you.
No.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
You're not here.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
New Praetor?

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Praetor?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Were we always explorers?
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Not so long.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
This is a mistake.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Praetor...
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Do you have children?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
I don't like it, George...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Hello George.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
What?
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Smile... good?
Minneapolis... good.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Closed?
No gas.
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
I want to try it.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I will see it next time.
Sun...
No... The closest...
Say it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
Are you angry at me?
I will go. But not you.
Where are you going?
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
They are beautiful.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
You sure this is your car?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Oh, Jesus.
You married, Major?
To the same woman?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
You can't just... kill him.
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Maybe.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
You think Tran killed her?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
That's not sayin' much.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You should feel like shit.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Let's work it.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
You just did.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
I always do.
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Are we having a bad night?
That would be no.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
I've got a good idea, yeah.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
You see Tran?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Besides that.
Have you had a chance to think about --
No.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Anybody talk to the press?
You run the plates?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Dylan here.
Hi there.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
A grill pattern.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What did he look like?
You have the photo from the diner?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
We have another one.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I'll take it into consideration.
I'm hesitant to...
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Why did you go to Chicago?
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
You are so fucked up.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
This is a sexy case.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
There are Agency regulations about this.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Hello?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You were right. He found me.
All the same killer?
What happened?
Agent...
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Agent Mackelway?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
What was your weakness, sir?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
If I owe, I will go.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Ever since I've known you.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Don't do it, Mike.
Hi.
I like quiche.
How?
Anything?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Who's your booking agent?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Well, I should be getting...
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.
Hi. Sorry about that.
You know, us.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
So what's the difference?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
Sounds more like Aids...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
They turned you down?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
How's it going for you two?
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
Wait.
That's not cool.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
You gotta do it.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
You think so?
I don't know...
Nice, baby.
Whatever.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Sorry about interrupting...
Christy was nice...
She was hot.
He drives a carriage.
I hear she's getting real fat.
What time's this party tonight?
...the Copa, in New York...
How you guys doing?
She didn't see.
What a surprise...
Is she looking at me, baby?
Now?
Is she looking now?
...You're just poking at it...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...honestly...
...Okay, two...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
What was that?
The food is on the table.
You heard about your father?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
I'll think about it.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Barzini will move against you first.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Corleone.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
I know about what you mean!
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Was there a definite proposal?
One of Tattaglia's people?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
What was that?
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
What about McCluskey?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Michael.
He'll be OK.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
When will I see you again?
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
A million times.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
And all his works?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
What? What?
I'll come down.
Shut up.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
What does he say?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Hello?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Dickie!
Hello Marge.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Dickie?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
How would you know that?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Will we see you later?
I've been backpacking.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Do you want me to stick around?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
I have!
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Huh?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
What hours do you work?
You must be rich.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Travis?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
This I gotta see.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
That's fine.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Huh?
I have.
Well... I guess so.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
That's a nice name.
I don't remember.
Listen...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Why?
You a narc?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Got your license?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm hip.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Wha -- ?
Real down.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Stick with Carla.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Partners?
Hi.
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
I'm sorry.
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Nine hundred...
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
Yes it does.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Are you saying that he's...
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
We've been closed for a while.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
But I...
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Luke... what time is it?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Cigarette?
Why not?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Found me.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
It's about me.
I suppose.  Thanks.
You hungry, son?
Miss Hayworth?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Would you like some brandy?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
I see.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Is anyone there?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Could I have a puff?
Are you coming to my party?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Mitch, let's turn back.
Good morning.
See where I'm pointing?
The two kids?
It's a surprise, you see.
Where would I get a boat?
Young woman cut herself.
Lovebirds, I see.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Whose side are you on?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mitch...
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
That's the last of it.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
These birds were...
He's not home.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Ouch!
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
Can't see a thing.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
But you tore it up.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You look a little shaken.
Last night? What do you mean?
Some cream?
Really? Tell me about it.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
How long have they been gathering there?
Do you want to try your father again? 
Santa Rosa?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Can we turn back?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
That... that... who was that?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Help how? What do you want to do?
How do you plan to do that?
Scotch, light on the water.
We need them.
I haven't finished my drink.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
But you did promise.
Yes, I suppose so.
We can't be sure of that.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What's that you say?
See that, Fettes?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
No.
It might be an interesting case.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
What did you hear?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
But where did they get those people?
Was the paralysis immediate?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
Two down. Two to go.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Fuck! What do you want?
Fucking Zombie.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
How do you know?
No...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Erin. Who?
You know.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
But you, you've had them.
Are you ok?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Well, we could--
I will be in just a minute.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Everyone seems so-- 
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
It must be twelve-thirty.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Hello.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Is it worth anything?
No -- no, thanks.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Well, how do I know who you are?
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
They're gaining on us!
Good.
Two down and two to go.
Death to all vampires!
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where's Star, David?!
He's not glowing.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
David.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Ouch, my hair...
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
... And stay outta here.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Wait a minute, kiddo.
We're getting close...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
Not funny, Sam!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Are you following me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Hi...
What's your name?
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
It's gone.  I feel it!
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What do you want from us?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
What you doin'?
How you doin', old boy?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Let's open it.
Let's open it.  Now...
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What do we do about those three?
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
We should have jumped his ass.
My God, what in hell happened here?
I guess you're okay.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
What's...
Tie up Clark, too.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
This storm do that?
Where was he trying to go?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Because you'll never die.
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
Yes...
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
This has to end.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
You took her because she helped me.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
And why not?
May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
You're late.
Well there's something new.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
All right, what is it now?
You're late.
Darling.
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I can't do that --
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Why?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
The mud carriers.
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
Yes... I suppose so.
Kalen...
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
And roosters.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
My father has gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
My fowl have polluted the yard.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
No, you're safe --
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Relax.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
How did you come to know their names?
Did you know my father?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Why?
How long do we have?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
You're sure?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Why, what would you do?
No. I don't want it to.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You don't understand.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Why not?
And how do you know that?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Can you drive?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
You want anything special for dinner?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Who's the nut?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
No!
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Alright.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Stop.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Did you get married real young?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
What did ya do?
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Is this your car?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means shut up, Thelma.
I'm cash poor.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
You're disturbed.
Thelma.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Whaddo we do?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We can live in a hacienda.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Hi!
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Nah.
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Well why don't you look her up?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Shoot.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Why's that?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Uh-huh. Where was he?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Healy you dog!
Nineteen months I been sober.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
How'd you know that?
I work with retards.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
How about -- ?
Lint?
So...
Mary ah, forget it.
Fuck!!
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
All you want is a phone number?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Uh, that's okay.
Miami?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
You know, I really should take your card.
You what?
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Thanks for picking me up.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Have you been up all night again?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
Good lookin'?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
So who you taking to the prom?
The prom -- you going?
And did everything -- ?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Is it the frank or the beans?
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Hey.
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
The sun came up today.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Max.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Should be here any minute.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
I don't want to listen to this again.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
What are you doing?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
I'll sleep around a little.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Ray...
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Why does he wanna see me?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Still after Jimmy?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Jesus. Oil?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
This Jimmy's?
Who did?
I desecrated it?
X21, give me a 20.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Do you want a coffee?
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
How so?
It's what?
The what?
What if he's not?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Let's make it at eight.
Anything.
You don't have to kill it.
Does it bother you?
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Food...and you...my F-14!
This is it, then.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I want it back.
What kind of games?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
I live here, remember?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Can't shake him.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
I've got it -- hold on!
You're not supposed to...
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Come on, we're next.
Something bothering you?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET LOST!
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Would you take me back? Would they?
So, where to?
First time on Mars?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What happened to them?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
I'm with an very important client.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
I'm listening.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Why not?
What trip?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
Are you saying she liked it?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
What are you doing?
--I got a trip to Mars.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
All right.
I give up.
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I love you.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
I said get out!
Now what?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
You know, up the jeep trail.
Oh my God.
So...now what?
You didn't cook breakfast?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Son of a bitch!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Use the fucking bomb!
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
What?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Gimme back my bottle.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
You see that? You wanna be like that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- Easy as that, huh?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
-- What?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
I embroidered.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Figures.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
I don't think I know that name.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Look. Mister --
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
No... No, go away.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Is there a golf course around here?
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Phillip?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
No.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Accidental?
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
You're not mad at me?
How did the car get back here?
You got it.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
We're on our way, Baby.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
I've got to see you.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You always hurt the ones you love.
You want to see...
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did you get this from your lover?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Yes.
...he wants to testify...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Just now...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
They lied.
I do. Yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection!
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
I used to be a nurse.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
What happened...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Gruber.
Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.
Uh...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
Right.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I just saw her.
Dr. Towler...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
They've all stopped at the same time.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
Nothing there now.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
Must be somebody in there.
They'll understand us, all right!
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
One of mom's cups got broken.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
These look quite fresh.
I want my kid out of here now!
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Who?
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
And...what's the man doing?
Home.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Darker.  More...evil?
You didn't jump in.
Seemed, not was.
The car's no there yet?
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Captured?  How?
That was Nancy, not me!
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
No, not really.  I...
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Well, that's all part of it.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Make us proud.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Why then.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Can we talk?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Ya know... "It".
So... What happened?
Where are you from any way?
That's how he died you know.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Uh, huh.
Can't do it.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Is that what you were trained to do?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Who is it Philip?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
They tell you that?
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
But, they don't speak English.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
It's outta here!
Suicidal...
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
For killing a dolphin.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
What's Cao Ben?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
No... I don't think so, man.
Whattaya mean family?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What is it?
You heard from Reggie?
No shit?!?! You know him?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
But I'm wild at heart.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
In a fire, as I recall.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
More'n likely.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
How much we got left, honey?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You knew my daddy?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
They have, sugar.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
And no AC.
You find any work?
Anything I can do for you?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
LULA!!!!
Mama???
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Just tell me what you want.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Explain it... I told you.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Emily?
You're stoned.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Is that just beer?
He has a book.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Crabtree.
So whose car is it?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Came to my senses.
I'll be... somewhere else.
You driving this car?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
I passed out.
The last month maybe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
No. There's no one here.
Vernon.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
So what are you doing out here?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
How did I get here last night?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Kinship. And what's here?
It feels really... good... here.
What?
I'm sorry.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
It's because you don't eat.
Where you going?
Near Carvel?
Get out of here.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Me? Sure. Why?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
New?
Emily left me this morning.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Who's he barking at now?
Excuse me?
No.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Who's that guy?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
It's not what you think.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
It's just a city park.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
What are you writing in that book?
I think you do.
Cherry?
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
You knew her?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Walter.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Robin?
What?
Yes.
What's her name?
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
And how's your job?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I don't understand.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Do you think you're crazy?
I mean, when will I be normal.
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
I want to be normal!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Please don't do it again.
No, I am not going to --
Who do you see?
Where?
A nap?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You plan to drink both those beers?
So... what's your dark secret?
So, you're not a dyke.
No you're not.
What's the problem?
Do you?
Tell me about it.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Being here, with me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
All three -- in chronological order.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Are you serious?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
We should live together.
It's a bad idea.
I've got problems.
I say we call it quits.
I don't need a plant.
Thank you.
Don't do that.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Nice shot, Lins.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You never did like being called that, did you?
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Fine.  Be that way.
No.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
I think it likes you.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
You see where it's coming in?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
'Fish'?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Hippy, you pussy.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Stand by on the ROV.
Getting a reading?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
A little more so this time.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Then I'll see you later.
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It's divine!
I'm not coming.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
And what are we going to do now?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
And what did they say about me?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
I would like to ask you something.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Because I'm getting fat.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
Of God.
Why?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Should you see a doctor?
First thing that comes to your mind?
He's told you?
I fell asleep.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
Would you like to be?
You liked Sister Paul?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She tells you you're ugly?
You're a mistake.
I really love you.
Why were you afraid?
Would you like to tell me?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Hm hmm.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Do you remember what just happened?
She said Michael.
Not your fault...
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Martha, it's you.
I'll have it.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Is that normal?
Could there have been anyone else?
That's absurd!
Not simple, no.
You hate us don't you?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
How?
All right, what do you need.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
There's nothing here.
The sheets...
When was that?
Your niece!
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
She's been touched by God, yes.
The father!
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
But how did it happen?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Lay them down.
They're yours.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Well --
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Are you going in?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
What's up?
Oh, there you are!
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
Oh!
Are you supposed to be here?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Aye, I knew you were.
What are you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Parading's better!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
A book!
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Hello, Grandfather!
And we're looking after him, are we?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
What are you doing there?
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Let's go and muck in.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
No.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
And my nose...
Temper! Temper!
He belongs to Paul.
None for me, then?
That's mine.
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
I'll set John on you!
What is he?
Engines off.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
What is it?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
<u>He</u> died.
Yes?  What is it?
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Yes?
Yes.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
It will be.
Look at that.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
Receiving.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
We do know that.
Yeah, okay. 
But?
Still worried?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Take us up.
Now what?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Two down, four to go.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
What is it?
Better?
Let's get back and call this in.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
When?
What's going on?
Deal.
Forget it, man.
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
Is it still moving?
Is this the suit?
Thanks.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Four.
Seltzer?
Do you believe him?
So, what do you think?
You have to...
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Hungry?
Just like that, eh?
Just like it.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
You know me better than that.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
I can't believe my ears...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Feeling better, my dear?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
When? When are you going to do it?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
I told her. I sounded off.
Take care of yourself out there...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Many happy returns of the day...
Okay.
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
I must have frightened her away.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Don't be condescending.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Yes, dear.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
How do you do, my dear.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
An answer.
She works hard.
She's loyal and efficient-
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Not at all.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
She's got to meet you-
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I think she would cheer.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
May I have your coat?
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
But the raves about your performance-
She knows enough not to be here.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
How much time have we?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Coming?
Lloyd, what happened...?
What time is it?
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Would you, really? How sweet-
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Who's left out there?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
Hello..
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Were you eyebrow reading?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
--Jesus--
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Tell that to Muskie.
But you know who did.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Hey... very tense.
Hey, easy...
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
One minute but then--
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Something maybe big.
Right.
What happens when the baby comes?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--I saw him. He verifies.
--what do you think?--
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Where?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Who's Charles Colson?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
--which Young?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
No, it was good.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
Me too.  For the most part.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
You want onions?
You're missing the game for us?!
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
No you haven't.
No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
You're not...busy?
Okay.
Dad!  I know!
Okay, I get it.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
No...you...go...ahead.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
That's my trick!
But you don't love me.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
That junior chick?
Bullshit.  From where?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
God. How can you eat like that?
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Andy! Holy shit!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I don't know...
They're coming!
Are you crazy!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Didn't even have to ask.
No wonder he let her go.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Claude...?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
Psychic awareness. Right.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Because Gaston was after it.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Not that I know.
Shit. I feel sick.
What've you got?
Now!
Merde.
Here.
Saint Severin...
Did I tell you that?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
No! Well, yes, but
Don't let me go!
Dmitri didn't want the money?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Trust me, it's her!
The "Odessa Dunk"?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'll show you!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
You are the boy ...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Perhaps you could convince her?
Hey, you on television?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Hey!
Singer!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
It's an important issue.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Lyndon Johnson?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Oh, you do?
Huh?
Your grammy!
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Yeah?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
No.  You're a wreck.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
And blind people, crippled...
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
M'hm.
Were you always funny?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
You're so sure about it.
You followed me!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
M'hm.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
What's- It's me, open up.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Two?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Happy birthday.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
This is my room.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I can think of another word.
Who said that?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
Probably on their first date, right?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Sixteen years ago.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Ah.
Forget it, Max.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
You all right?
How about a ginger ale?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh. What about?
Oh.
Yeah.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you know the contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Had a little help?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
It's going.  It's going.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Honey?
Why didn't you bring him?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Never.
That for us?
Just did.  Jealous?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
What is it?
And?
Oh.  You're them.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Go.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
What?
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
What?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
In the kitchen.
Okay, knock it off.
Don't be so sure.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It's not like this all the time.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I know.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Yes, she is.
No.
Not long.
You got your DP?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
I've never done this before.
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Of course it's alright.
What?
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
That was my clue.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you lovesick?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
How?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Everyday.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Um.  Happy for you.
You're my best friend.
What did I do?
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
He's a novelist.
Nevermind.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
And you are...?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
We're going to die!
So what makes you so special?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Who is that idiot?
Bala!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Z!  Over here!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Affirmative.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
Yes, what else?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
...I should?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I hope everything goes all right.
Good night.
No.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
What gave you that idea?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
What is it?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
His apartment?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
There's a call for you --
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
I mean, after that?
Oh.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
You know how people talk.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
You can't come in.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
What are you going to do, Doc?
What's her name?
I'm not sure.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
What's this -- you packing?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
What about him?
Who is Mickey?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Family?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Doctor.
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
You fool -- you damn fool.
That's right.
It's been hell.
I want you back, Fran.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Coming?
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
You're out of your skull --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
We've been attacked.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
What do you see?
Charlie?
Who's he?
What are we doing here?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Listen.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Touchy.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Captain?
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
What's your name, sailor ?
How big it is?
Change.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
What'd you do for supplies?
Can you trust them?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Do you?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Did you know him very well?
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Who are you?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
What if I say no.

What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Where'd you say Eric is?
He's coming around fine.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Be careful, okay?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Surviving is what I know --
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Be my guest.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Can you walk?
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
You better get some sleep.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Go easy.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
What about your mother?
Why did yo do this for me?
Getting loud, getting loud.
The stiff one eye?
I can't. I work.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
And?
I don't.
What do you want?
Grouchy?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Can you not be violent?
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Help!
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
No touch. No touch. No touch.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
She's nice.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Good evening.
Shall I get her for you?
No. Please, don't force him.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Now we'll both call him.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
No shit.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Bain.  Michael Bain.
What does that fucking mean?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
You want me to pump?
And you want to use me to get him?
Electra.
It looks like white's game.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
They become complicated... messy.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
Good.
Hey, where are you?
Breakfast.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
That's right.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't believe that.
What happened?
Do you have ulcers?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Nobody ever sees me.
Did you --
Was she the only one?
Uh-huh.
Four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
I wasn't watching television.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
How much farther?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Right.
What are you thinking about?
Some.
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
Cheers Katka!
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Oh yeah, what's that?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
That stinks!
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I've been saying that since we met.
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
We're going to need it all.
Like a hand?
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Damn!
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
I can't go with him.
It's that one isn't it.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
We should be done by the weekend.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
She's tired.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
But we could go to London and live in England.
Forget about me Kat.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
They'll do it.
Okay?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Seems a shame!
Shall I wash these out?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Run into Josh?
Why don't we both forget about him?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
I'm not sure it's possible.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
So, he didn't fire you?
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
I don't want to go.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Why not?
Out with Belinda?
To see your father?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
What are you doing here?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
The address?!
Who are you?
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
This play -- ?
What's with the friggin numbers?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
You got some kind of list?
You think so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
He okay?
People can see.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
So you're talking to me?
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
We can measure wind.
How do you know this place?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Nope.
What are you thinking?
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
But if you could, you would?
What's Landon Carter up to?
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
So talk to us about something.
How about your family?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What's N.R.C.?
Hi, Marty!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Huh?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Why what?
Your line, George!
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Eight thirty.
Catch you later! 
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Marty, that would alter history.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Pardon me?
How did you know?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Where did you get this?
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
That's all taken care of.
You didn't?
What year is this?
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Pretty, isn't it?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Gone?... Where?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
How you doing, Cato?
Where'd you get them antlers?
That's what he told you, huh?
What do you feed him?
You lost that one?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Jack.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
Yeah.
Nothing.
Why not?
What a nice place.
Somebody else is going to get it.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I came in the front.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Look at all this junk.
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
What?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
You're my friend, aren't you?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Then what?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
What crate?
You're a welcome sight...
Anybody we know?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
He offered you money?
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
Another 'you'?
You keep an eye on it.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What's his problem?
Hello, Barton.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton!
...This'll sometimes help.
How d'ya like your room!
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Well that's what he said.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...Huh? No, I'm –
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
A souse!
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...That's fine.
Sound a little what?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
...This must be boring you.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Sure, Charlie.
It's more than I've got.
...Yes, thank you.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Transient or resident?
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Take care, you hear?
How's not smoking?
Yes.
Who?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
She told you, didn't she?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Did you leave the club with him?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you didn't hurt --
I'm tired.
Am I... disturbing you?
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Why does he do it?
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Do you believe me?
What did he say?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
What kind of drugs?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
You think I --
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You feeling better?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Maybe the maid did it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
You knew her, didn't you?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Is this finished yet?
Naa..
Of what?
Ten bucks apiece.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Piss painting?
These are great.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Hey – Willie Mays.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
Your people.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
You gonna carry that around all night?
I don't really have any problems.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
You do! You definitely do.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Do you know what he's saying?
... What's the matter?
You're back.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
It looks done.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
That is amazing. What year is it?
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Admiring your handiwork?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
We've met.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
I'm listed.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
I don't.  So, no.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
You're loosing your cool
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Watch the first step.
How did you...?
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
Winded, old timer?
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
What say we turn up the heat?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Actually, he took the car.
Maybe they're right.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
...Afraid.
All the answers are numbers.
What now sir?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Up here, Al.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
That kid is amazing.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
But...
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Find anything interesting?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Back off, man.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
I'll show you it works.
...or death.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
A hit.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Thank you, Vicki.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
No.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
And you want a --
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
There aren't hotels?
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Ali?  What's wrong?
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Oh yes.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
You're not going to ....
No!
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Me first.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Really? I poop too much.
They perk me right up.
Does that say Xanax?
...Two...
Cavity search...?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
She sure does.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
You got two seconds!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You'll be rich!
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Wave at the lion.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That little girl saw us.
My God, we're back where we started.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
She's only fourteen...
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
What time is it?
Aren't you scared?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Did you get the paint?
So can I?
Help vouchers?
Just get some people out of our house.
We're very unhappy.
No.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Tell the truth.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I don't know what that signal means.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's your cousin.
Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Is this the key to the attic?
Their wedding clothes.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... Were you going somewhere?
He does, does he?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Would you care for a drink?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Chauncey...
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Can you see well?
Do you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Certainly, Ben.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Some pictures...?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
... My suitcase.
... That is a very small room.
... Evening, Chance.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Correct.
Yes. It has.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sid, it's useless!
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Would you take me on a tour?
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I never played a jewel thief.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Why, Craig. why?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hi.
Did you eat?
Now?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
So how was it? What was he doing?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
You've always hated the animals.
What about Maxine?
And he was with her.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You fell in love with her first.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
My God!
People make mistakes.
Maxine...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Yex?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Dr. Lester...
Yes, well...
Somebody told you.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
What'll you have?
That's the usual?
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
This is important!
You wanted to be partners with me?
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
You can be John Malkovich.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
What kind of circumstances?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Thank you, Floris.
Do you dream often?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But of course.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Oh, be still my heart.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
What's the play?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
You still there, sweets?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
Sleepy suddenly.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Captain Mertin?
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
There ain't.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You grown.
Be here. In case.
They good whitefolks?
Could be that fall you took.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
The church!
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You remember your price, Stamp?
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Yeah?
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
I know my rights.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Excuse me?
Yeah.
What's this?
They range up to three thousand.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please!  Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Take it easy, Dude.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Huh?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Have it your way.  The point is--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
That wasn't her toe.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Thanks Walter.
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
This driveway.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
There weren't any shots.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
'Scuse me?
Fuckin' A.
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Walter--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
You come all the way down here to roust--
What?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Two years.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
What was that?
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
You're hurting me.
How does it look?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
Yes?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Get in. You’re leaving.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
-- he's a vampire.
But, he could've --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
What is this place?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
What am I injecting you with?
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Get out of here --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
What happens then?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Blade --
What -- ?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
How did you escape?
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
What happened to the power?
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
Inside the grave?
Why?
What's she look like?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Looks like business is booming.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--<u>myth</u>--
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Baby names?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
What can I get you?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
The witch?
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
I don't believe this.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
English.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
What the fuck--??
Yeah. Me too.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
Who?
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
Hold this.
Cotter?
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Okay, but--
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Running a junk yard.
--whatever you want, no problem--
What?
Pointless.
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
What?
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
I should check on Anna.
"It's why the witch kills children."
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Ray?
Who was it?
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You called me this morning.
...So?
So how long have you know Meurice?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
He needs a room, Dusty.
Sure don't.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...You know that car?
What's the matter?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Well what?
...There's a big--
...What?
...Count it if you want.
What's this?
Pour that back.
Where was I?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
. I. uh.
No. I should go.
Do you love me?
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
I guess I should go.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Yeah. but.
Okay. thanks.
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah?
Okay. be careful.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
How ya doin' Dad?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Can I use the car tonight?
Nothing. I'm fine.
No.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
This is it for me.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
The coca is my responsibility!
Mirtha.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
You?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
What kind of project?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
What's the matter, George?
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Touche.
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Well, you know.  It's um...
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Money.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I know.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You're not going to trial?
Tell Mom, you know...
How are you doing, George?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Do I know you?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
No, that's alright.
What?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What do you want from me?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
There's schools in California.
I swear.  On my life.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Yeah?
It's not enough.
Holy shit, Dulli!
No shit, Kevin?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
With an unloaded pistol?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Go away!
What is she saying?
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
How you doin' Mister D?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
About three hours.
What can we prove?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Objection sustained.
Can you?
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Tell the court about that, please.
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Can you give the court an example?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
What kind of information?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Yes.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What happened?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I suppose.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Dristan nasal spray.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Why not?
-- And then?
Can we get out of here?
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
That's not an answer.
Hello?
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
You were brilliant today.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I'm dropping the case.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Hello?
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
She sounds like quite a woman.
Is that alright, Frank?
I know.
It's more involved than that.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, that's a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Yeah.
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Grateful!?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Madge?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No, really?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Lemon?
Where are you staying while you're here?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Help cook?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
Francesca?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I'll pick you up.
Oh.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Can I help?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
But you don't mind.
Uh-huh. And?
How do you know what I experience?
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No. Don't do this.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm positive.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
It clearly states in the will --
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
We can climb out.
Looking to score?
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aren't you going to join us?
And what's that?
Why?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
We gotta jump!
Where is it?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Not really to live, just to play.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Open the case!
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
Sit down, Gino!
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Tell them!  Tell them!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What are you doing?
Where is the money?
I saved you.
You murdered Gino!
We were in a car accident --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
What?  How about a drink?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
You can't kill me yet.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Hello?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.
'63 Chevy.
Do you know him?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
You said he washed the money?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I'm just asking, what if?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Oh, God.
What do you mean?
What is Treadstone?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Sir, you waited on line.
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We thought you were gone for good.
I've got a situation here and --
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
What does that mean?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I needed a break.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Where?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
He's dead isn't he?
He came to kill us.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
What is that?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
Where did this body go?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Where's the dog?
Get in the basement.
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
What if it doesn't come back?
...ervices.
...ven't you?
Sign here, please.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
Sorry ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Long time no see!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
What's she done?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Out of kindness.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack?... Jack?
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
You stupid bastard!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Yes.
Stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Why not?
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Look at that - right on time.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
What happened to you after ...
They're gone.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh, good!
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
A cheque.
Try next of kin.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
That's it.
Damn! Blast!
What?
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Mother? Is that you?
Uh ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
This is an emergency!
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
My I.D. cards.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Are you expecting anyone?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No underwear?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I guess I'll be going.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Okay, what happened?
You're not going to die.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
He's very very sick.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
You shouldn't smoke.
I think this place stinks.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
You married?
Five years.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
What do you think?
The family know?
Last show of the night.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Whatja doing?
The brakes are shot.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
They'll just keep calling.
Faster! God!
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Shut up a second...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Yes.
Wait.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
What did they do with you?
London.
I don't think so.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
Hi.
He excels at gratitude.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Did you bring your grey suit?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
I think you're the Devil.
How?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Do it then.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Goodbye, Paul.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Yes.  That's right.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Anchor?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
So you like me, huh?
So what did you think?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
What?
Then give me a minute...
I knew what you meant.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
This is very awkward.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
What are you doing here?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
A girl with a body like mine?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
See you later -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Oh yeah?
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Where where...
Nice night out...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Maybe so...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
There's that weird dude again.
What did he say?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Dead Cat!
Yeah.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Go home.
H-have a seat?
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Police officer.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Hi.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I'm hungry.
Excellent.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
He doesn't look fifty.
Buffy, honey?
Something like that.
What show is this?
What'd you dream about?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
Hi.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Hey, Buffy...
Thanks.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
He did what he was supposed to.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
Are you okay?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Beverly Center.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
None of your business.  God.
Not a pressing issue.
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Put your head back.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You are such a wet.
Watchers?
I'm curious, is all.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
No THX.
Come one, that was so weird.
That is so cool.
I don't get it.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
I haven't seen him tonight.
The mark of the Coven.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
Okay, let's go.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
What happened?
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Buffy!
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
Except for Prom.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
I'm yours.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I think you're real cute.
It's Skip, for you.
Neither will I.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I don't dance.
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Don't tell anybody.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
And now you wanta teach me?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why baseball?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got released.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
God bless you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
What's that?
You a God damn witch?
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Party without me.
I was great, eh?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
I'm going to the Show.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Don't try me.
No way.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Where's Ebby?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and twenty-four.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Ain't here.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
That's right.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
You got it.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
...stupid things.
Hey!
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Now this is just a signature card.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Ohh!
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
You think he got the point?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
Yes, you lost your control.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Ginger called me.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
How'd you know I was here?
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Okay. You come by the house?
You go and put your things away.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Half of everything is mine.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Okay, thank you for asking.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You all right?
Why're you crying?
You sure?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hello.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Yeah.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Yeah.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Get off of me! Stop it!
The arrangement is over!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You threw it away?
With Jennifer.
I had a... salad.
I was with somebody.
You are not threatening me anymore!
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
...worst possible time for me.
No, Sir.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Is that what you did?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Carmine left?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Artie! Artie!
Hey, Frankie.
And I mean... that's no good.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Uh-huh. Good.
Hi, Jennifer.
Tell me.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Thanks.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
No, he's not.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm here.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
...all the luck in the world.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
...they're in Penthouse K.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Well, how come I laid nine?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Don't know.
Whoa. Calm down.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Again!
I know it, I know it.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Women, huh?
You're kidding.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I'm a good mother!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Good morning.
Did you try to kill...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Okay, deal.
You're late.
Don't sneak up on me...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
You seem sad, Spooky.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
You switched license plates?
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
If you know that just back off.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Nels?
Any minute.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
What makes you say that?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Do you know what's in that box?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Rachel -- Oh my God.
It's locked.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
The guy with the transplant.
You timed that beautifully.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Who's in back?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
What's that supposed to me?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
I'm still okay.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Naturally.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Pass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Sure.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Satisfied?
We're waiting on you.
It's in the process.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Seems like it.
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Scottish?
It takes all types.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
He gave me a look.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
Fuck off, Dave.
Don't be like that --
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
That Dave?
No --
Do I?
Maybe.
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Don't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Happy now?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
It's her, isn't it?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She from Scotland too?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You do something for me, Dil?
You'd do anything for me?
You want to make me look like him...
You like me better like this.
Why?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Good-bye, Dil
Died...
You killed my Jody
You didn't.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
You like me now, Jimmy?
More endearments.
Love me.
What would you do for me?
She was --
Not if you go.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Hey -- what's he like?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Leave her out of this.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Give him a cup of tea.
So he knows your name?
You OK about that?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Hope not.
I seen your fucking face.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
Hey --
I'm not a gambling man.
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why not?
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Never.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Can't.
Now put it back in.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Why?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Do you?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
You stupid bastard --
What?
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
I never know nothing.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
What's the matter?
Where's that airlines bag?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Of course there is!
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
No, what?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Then how do I know this is your office?
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
Oh.
What now?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Not my room!
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
I'm not fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
The phone's ringing --
What day is it?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I'd love some, thanks.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Yes, I know.
What are you doing?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Why don't you shut up!
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
Please keep it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
What do you mean, no?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
Where did he keep his money?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
I don't understand.
No -- in my room.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Good for you.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
What are you doing here?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Instant divorce you mean?
What's going on?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
You mean you and me?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Nothing. Good night.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Who is it from?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
is there anything you do?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
You know her?
Should we close down any eruption?
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
She was murdered?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No, you couldn't.
Then you should go.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
Go sit next to him.
Mark Shale.
No!
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Why?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
My dad's down there!
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Who?
What are you doing?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
That wasn't me ...


Shit!
A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, huh?
...and fair...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
All right.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
That dog ain't mean.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...-ed.
...town. 
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck! That's...
...fine.


    Elvis is on ice again.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...-er!
You wanna hit me?
...I believe in live and...
...waiting!

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
...do we?
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
...easy, easy, easy.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
Whoo!
I made it!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
...ho!

Hang on!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.

You're--?  What?!
Keep still.

Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...truck.
How wonderful for you.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...shit.
Not completely, anyway.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
They're takin' off.
Arlo, shut up.

Okay. 
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Here...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Who put the big hurt on...
You.
Us.  Owes us.
Thank you very much.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
We're worried...
But...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
What?  Say again...
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...-lar.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.
"I am become Death, the...

Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...about--
No, go--
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Brynner.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Hit him again.
I'm on it.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Right.  Tim Mason.
Assumptions are always...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Doc...
...should be right outside.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.



No.
Dead, last time I...
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Great.  All right...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Mason.
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
 ...miles. 
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Where are you now...
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...tunnel now!
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
An honest living.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Of course I do. Where are you?
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
I'm not.
Where did you get this material?
How do they do that?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
That's it?
Well, let's go.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Iced tea.
What?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Mr. Gittes.
I can't tell you.
For very long?
K... Cross.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Know him?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
We got it. We got it, baby.
As little as possible.
...No. Why was it.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
I know.
I saw him.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Do? To who?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Yeah, Sophie.
There's just one question.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Do you know me?
Have we ever met?
Never?
The water.
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
The L.A. River?
Of course not.
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
This?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
What are you doing here?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
How's school?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
You weren't expecting me?
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
So what'd they say?
My husband...you know him.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
How long's it been shut?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Mr. Kane -
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Three cents.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Who else you been to see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
But, Mr. Kane -
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
Thanks.
A chicken?
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Is that what you want to do?
Yes -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
I mean I've got a job for you.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
What?
I'm drunk.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
She's plastered, isn't she?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
What's this?
It's not the same.
Fifty-five.
Yeah, but not in here.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
God, isn't he great?
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Why?
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Was I right?
I'm giving him his ring back.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
You're such an asshole.
How'd you get here so fast?
This is the last time I come to this place.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
You don't want to know.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Five years.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
The quest isn't going well?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Which ones?
No.
Why'd you apologize?
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
Design major.
Julie Dwyer died.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hardly knew her!
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
An embolism in a pool.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
Oh, my god.
He made it, hunhh?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Jesus!
You're happy?
Now I know you're lying.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Who eats cock?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
This life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Like ten after.
It's not like I'm miles away.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I am not.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Are there any balls down there?!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
You calling me a liar?
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
What were you doing up so late?
What? What is that?
"Be there?"
How many?
It better be up to and including me.
Why do you call him that?
You sucked his dick!
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Well...?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
You had to tell him.
What did he say?
Thank you for being rational.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
It stings a little.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Did he say "making fuck?"
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Sure. How about the beach?
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
And... he told you all of this?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I will. Take it easy.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
C-4?
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Enough.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Excuse me?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
A flare up...
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
I can't believe you just said that.
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Gabe!
Thanks for holding on.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Travers, you're not running things.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Have her come up.
Then where the fuck is!
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Go after her.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
What's the code, Travers?
Rich...
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Thank you very much, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
What crime did you commit.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What do I want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Let me get up.
No, sir.
Blue eyes?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
The ride is free.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Max, the cab driver!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Remember what you played?
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
I got caught up at work.
You're gonna cheer up.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'm standing right here.
He's not paying you one cent!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Hello?
You prefer nights?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You - you killed him?
Got it?
You better?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
You go every night?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
What, no insurance?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Who's Heller?
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
You're going too fast.
They said send you downstairs.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You want something to drink?
Equitation.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Was that who I thought it was?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
That was him.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Murdered?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
I don't understand.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Love at first sight?
Back where?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
How did you know?
Geronimo is down.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I love you, too.
I'm a very patient man.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Where'd you get it?
Night after that?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Which way did he go?
Agent Lowry.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Do you believe me?
I want to believe you, too.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
You know why I'm here.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
What?
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
What...
What?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
You're not real.  None of this is.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Can you show me?
Am I one... or many?
I didn't realize I was out.
What's that?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
I'd say this is slightly different.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
Greenbank?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Champagne please.
How do you mean?
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Lookit her bounce.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Go git it, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here's the Patrol.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
A cold drink? Okay?
Somebody say somethin'?
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
What you mean, Luke?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Like I always do?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
I'm in.
Cuter again.
Kick a buck.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Now look what you did.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
What?  What'd I do?
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
I thought he was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Because of your phone calls.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
How do you know that?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
But it's a different m.o.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
What's that siren?
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Who's the married man?
Maybe you should...
Tell me what to do!
The lock...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
I was.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
What's Abba?
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
You messed with the scene.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Oh, maaaaan?!
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Detective Niccoletti?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
He's not treating her right...
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Do you find him attractive?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
What is it?
What does he want from you?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Fuck me.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
What's his name, Letty?
You did the right thing.
But what am I going to do?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I haven't had a crush since I was
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
I'm really not that hungry.
It had this red spot on its back.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Don't take it personally.
What are you looking to read?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Really, this isn't funny.
A small price.
A daisy for the lady.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
Then it's over.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Michael.
Not yet.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I sure know what that feels like.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Yeah?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Yes, I suppose so.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Getting back.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
A pass.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Oui.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
And for my help I would get what?
And the other half?
Yeah.   We just go home.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
I'm going to kill him myself!
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You're sure?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
All right, knock it off.
Anybody hungry?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
I will.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
I'm from Belgium.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Everything.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
What'd you guys find?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Yes.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
This kind.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
The money isn't here.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Who's gonna see it there?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What are you doing?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Okay.    Okay.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Why do you want to teach me?
You're home late... or should I say early?
You're already a thief.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'll give them to you.
They forced me to marry!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
What was it?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
No.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No, not yet...
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Don't you want to see her again.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
I don't know...
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
Talent. Hi.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
Mister Funboy.
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
That thing is poisonous.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I've got him if you want him.
Have we met?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Why not?
You a lesbo?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Romantic? He rapes her.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Somerset Maugham.
Am I bothering you?
Because I'm in love with you.
You really want to know?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Hi.
But you knew this was important to me.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Are you for real?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Well do you like him?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
What do you mean?!
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
What are you doing?
Just a kiss, right?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes!
Yes!
Where is she?!
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I'll think about it...
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
You would not believe what--
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Any day now.
You amaze me.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Bad time?
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
To my triumph, of course.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
You're too kind.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
What do you want?
She's out.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Oh, hello.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
Did your wishes ever come true?
The Farren house
She was very pretty.
Oh, thank you, darling.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Did you hear the child out?
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
What's funny?
That's the Farren house.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
I got lots of presents.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Why didn't you run after them?
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
I've wanted a friend.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
But you must!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
You?
A lady threw it to me.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry!
Mother! You called me by name!
Let the child stay.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
Do you really need these?
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Charming Carlton.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Hello?
Oh no.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Peter knows something.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Fall in love.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I think George knows.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Uh huh. So pee.
Coffee and...
No.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
I really gotta get going.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Is that how you feel?
What's with the squirt guns?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
We can get a warrant if you like.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
You want her sheets?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Dammit!
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
You see it?
Where does it lead?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Why?
What is it?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Don't say a .
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm not certain about...
What the hell is this?
What do you think you're doing?!
Where's the girl?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Are you threatening me?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Presence.
Gimme a quarter.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Alan...
Yes, Mr. President?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Something like what...
How'd you get started?
Your government needs your help.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh... Yeah.
Where's home?
How were you gonna get home?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Help me get him to the boat.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
How long do we have to watch him?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Where are you going, Tyler?
What'dya get?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
Sounds boring to me.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
It will?  How do you figure?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yeah?  Like what?
I think he's sweet.
You know what really excites me about you?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
That's your sister school, right?
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Too bad.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
But father, it's not fair.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
You know me, always taking on too much.
What is this, a midnight study group?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
And now he will?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Who?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Who gives a shit about aft?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Got it?
Yeah you did...
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Finnegan...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What was that?
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked us both.
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
You mean...?
How was huntin'?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Holy shit!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Sal.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
What are you doing?
You seem... disturbed.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Nick, he just came back.
Pow?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What's that noise?
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
What?
Yeah.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
No!
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Funny guy.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You're working a partner on this.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Sir---
Need help?
Nobody's looking.
You my partner?
I'm ready.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
How then?
What's this place?
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Wanna try?
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
You treat her nice.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
You could always take it off.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Gee -- that Fair --
What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Howdy, Jabez.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
-- in gold.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
What's the matter with you?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Coming along, Jabez?
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
I'll get the doctor.
But I'm glad to be home again --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Come in, Sheriff.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
I can't be honest with them.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Where are you going?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Nothing...
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Hans.  Your Hans.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Yo!
Encourage them to be bolder.
I...have a request.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
They would, huh?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Al?  Al, you there?
They way you drive, I can see why.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What's going on?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Is that him?
This is --
Gene -- you smilin'?
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
What guns?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah...
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
So!  Sal is with you?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... yeah.
He's makin' threats in there.
What kind of things, Leon?
Sonny-boy, one word?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Calm down, you're not ...
Sonny, be reasonable!
What the fuck do you want?
You tryin' to fuck me?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
The gun's right on your back...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Where's the back door?
Now, you -- what's your name?
What if I take you with me?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Mister Mulvaney?
You all right?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Because I don't want cancer.
Goddamn women...
To show that we're negotiating.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Sonny -
I never been up in a plane before.
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
What are you trying to pull?
Hey, you okay?
Fuck!  We did it!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
Why are you doing this?
Robbing a bank.
This is Bishop.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Who the hell is that?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Cunt.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Something is going down. Something bad.
What did he say about the arm?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Where is Domino?
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I'm gonna leave now.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Don't come back, either.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Squash it.
You're a drunk fool.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Mookie.
Ten.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Sweet Dick Willie.
ML?
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Before I get off work.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Shit!  I forgot.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
Tina, you're sweating.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Be a man.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
I didn't know you could read.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
That's what you think?
I'll do that.
I'm listening.
How do you know this?
Hey!  Watch it.
Turn it off.
The both of youse, shaddup.
How ya doin', Mookie?
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
You did?
Excuse me?
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
I think it's just over there.
No no no no no.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Where did you learn that word?
No.
I don't know. Owwww.
Owww.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
How do you know it's for us?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
I don't think so.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
It's okay. I want the rush.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
But my mom gave me the map.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
She's one of a kind.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
So can I come along?
I thought I told you to get lost.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So, when can we do it?
Do I know you?
Sure.
Hey you two. Lights out.
How was that?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
What?
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
It's the big potato.
Times two.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
I can assure you...
So, this is Leto the Just...
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Do you know this my lady?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Man-carved steps.
Are you a Fremen?
Will we see a worm?
Why do they come?
Liet?
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Bela, what happened?!
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
You'll be sitting on the right.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Why are you here??
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
And, cut...
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
It takes me comfortable.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Goddamn landlord.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Dolores, wait!
I kinda need it now.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
Mr. Reynolds!
Could we moovf to table?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
I think you're quite handsome.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Is there a script?
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
What was that?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're sure this is gonna work?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
What?!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know what would be great?
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I don't think so.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No. It's a mess.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
I can't?
Our what?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Hey, Lou.
What do you want?!
Ha!
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh my God.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Oh God, this is so weird.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So...?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Kinda'.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hi, Shari.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
We don't have foibles.
How?
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
What?
NO, that's fine
What do you mean?
Hello, Mr. M.
Where to?
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
What is it. Tammy?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And how did you get in the school?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Shall we give it a name?
Three twenty-five.
What do you want, Jim?
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
And she's super-nice
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
What?
What...?
Are you crazy?
Who put you up to this?
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Can I sign yours too?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
What do you want?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Somebody hit you?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How what, Wendell?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Where are we going?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Why?
What?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
You expecting problems?
Bud...
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Richard Stensland.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
What do you want to know?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You're wrong.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
It's a simple question.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Lynn Bracken.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
How about White?
I'll take your word for it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Do you have any proof?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Working whores with squad two.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'm doing a transfer now.
It is?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
I didn't use my name.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
I intercepted phone calls.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
What the fuck?!
You're driving.
We lost 'em.
Drive.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
How?
Pretty fast.
What are you dialing?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
You should take this seriously.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Stacy?
You <u>swore</u>!
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
It wasn't me.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I was missing you.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
My suitcase--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
Thank you.
I gotta go.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Rachel--
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
Any idea what he looks like?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Your shoe.
Who would do that?
Bobby--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
You gotta--
No, I--
Turn yourself in.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Was Zavitz in trouble?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Am I to understand--
Who?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Yes sir.
How'd you get in the building?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
No thank you.
Then let's assume I don't.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
That insults them.
You felt obliged to.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
I'm impressed you can sew.
What do you hate most?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Dance with me.
You're wearing the thimble.
Shall we be all right?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
It's Geoffrey under this.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I was talking about the girl.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Irving Berlin.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
What did you say?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
The team is in mourning, darling.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Oh.
Right.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
How?  How can you see anything?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's Canadian.
He needn't disturb you.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
I'm still here.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Will you come with me?
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Certainly not.
Or my wife's.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
That's doable.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I have a question...
Why are we speaking Chinese?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
I've got something...
But Roki said--
We going somewhere?
Maybe I should drive this time.
You want me to pick up a painting?
He says they turned the card down.
You stole my luggage? You--
What's my problem? You want a list?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
And good morning.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
True enough.
I'll need that.
Let's do it again.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Aren't we early?
We're working.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Got it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
That's because you grew up rich.
Not for me.
Jesus God, it's going through.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Hang on.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You look like George Washington.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
250,000?
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Fax these to this number, okay?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
What's chromium?
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
The judge came up with a number.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
All I have is hundreds.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
This is the only thing you found?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Bullshit.
How many families we talking about here?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
What now?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
What's a demur?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
How dare you take that away from me.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Why not?
Ho - ly - shit.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
I wasn't gonna --
When'd they file the demur?
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Yeah.  A real moron.
PG& -- Are you sure?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
No.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You are someone.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Thank you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
No, I need my car --
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Someone stole my stuff.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
I am not talking to you, bitch.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
You're moving away?  When?
Who's Baxter?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, My Lord.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He'll learn.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
... Luke, you must not go.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks his concern.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Yeah ...
Give me that!
Mine, mine.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Yes sir!
I have felt it.
Our destruction?  Who?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
That's right.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Sir, I was wondering ...
I think we're in trouble.
Not you?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
What are you afraid of?
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
I don't like this.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Get out of here, Lando!
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Leia!
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Will they die?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
May I say something personal?
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Who's that?
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Shit.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Plissken...?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Getting ready to invade.
Stop the damn car.
I said pull over.
Not yet.
Aw, come on, Snake.
Is that what I think it is?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Snake - what is it?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Good day to you, sir.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Arthur.
Perceval, you have returned!
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
What book is that?
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Guenevere...
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Yes.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
And you cannot love me...
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Who?!
Me?
The law forbids it.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
You are truly magnificent!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
The oath. You didn't say--
What honey?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Hi
Dinner at the White House.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
I'm gonna miss you.
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
How are you today?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
About my daughter?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
I didn't get you?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Did you know my mother died recently?
Wanna drink.
Where's Regan's father?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
We'll see when we get home okay.
You've been playing with it?
Oh I bet he is.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Mr. Dennings?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh my God!
Hi Chris. Great party.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
I believe you.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Think you can sleep?
Lieutenant?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Where's Regan?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
No now.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Shut up!!
What is it?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
It's my goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Just the same.
Beasley.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Twenty years, Ma ...
What's the gig?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
That's not the point.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
You're their uncle.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
No, I mean it.
So what'd we get her?
Yeah?
A gust of wind killed him.
Sure, why not.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
That's what we agreed.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
What's the matter?
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
See anything?
Just a lucky guess.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Unless you want the right.
Why would I mind?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What?
How's it coming?
Funny, huh?
What're you doing down here?
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
What?
We're not getting paid then.
What?
What?
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
A seven.
They're tight.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Oh, thanks.
Jack, you with us?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
Hey, will you look at that?
Got another song for us?
What's with you guys?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
I can't sing it anymore.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
And you don't?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
So why's he do it?
You were good.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
You can always get another girl.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
What kind?
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
My days are not the old days, genius.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
He's lying.
Perfect fit.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
I took it from my fake husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What do you mean?
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
How is he?
How's Loomis?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You killed them?
Stay away from my family!
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Clarissa left those here.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Kim?
You've got someone in your office.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What about me?
You'd have to start immediately.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
What are you doing?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You have kids, Jack?
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Jack, are you okay?
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
They did a pretty good job.
This is day care.  It’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
We’re friends, aren’t we?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Damn...
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
You just said everyone needs something.
Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Jack...don’t even start...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
What are you doing?
Why not?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hey!  I was watching that!
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
No?
Excuse me?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Not it...?
Maybe I should wait...
You really are incredible...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
You’re so...beautiful...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Don’t do that...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
What’s going on?
To Paris. Paris, France.
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Don’t get on that plane!
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Not by a long shot.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
How'd you know it was me?
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
How long was I out?
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
I'll be watching over you.
Ben?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Back it down, Johnny!
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
You're really cramping my style here.
Sweet.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Leonard, how's the feed?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
But I'm not done with the machine --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Where do we stand?
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Benes... What the devil happened?
How bad off is he?
Wish I knew why.
Right, sir.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Doctor...
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Look at that...they're changing color...
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
A surgeon might...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Thank you for saving my life.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
It's against my better Judgment...
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
You have no right to blame Duval --
Looks like somebody declared war.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I don't believe that.
I can't tell you.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
All in all, quite a canoe...
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
I'll never find my way through that.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Drop that fucking money!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
...Blood has been shed.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, don't be silly.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Yah.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, but -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah!
Yah.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
...Dad?
Yah, pretty good.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
I mean a parking lot.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan and I're okay.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, I just -
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, that's a good one.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Hello?
...Hello?
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
It's just the three cent.
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
That wouldn't interest you.
What... ?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You are?!
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
We need to talk.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
I'm in pain.
It becomes an addiction.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
In case we want to switch nights.
I'm just on my way out...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
What are you talking about?
Make sure.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
He's not here.
Is that what you're calling it?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Say my name.
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
You got about thirty seconds.
What?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Why are you doing this?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
... and you come home to this.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Thank you.
What?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
I don't follow...
Would that be a problem?
They're called "cigarette burns."
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're okay with this?
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Promise you won't.
You get rid of her.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Tyler...
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
"Applicant?"
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You have jobs.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
You want out?
Defuse the bomb?
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
NO...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Look at me...
Who is this?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Did you hear what I just said?!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Biology, mostly.
I... I don't know...
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
You have to tell us now.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
What do you want me to do?
No!  It can't be.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Whoa, nine months?
Stop it, don't move him!
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
What is it?  What are you?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
That's why I was there last night.
4:25.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Most kids do, I guess.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Fag.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Cuticle lacerations.
Knock it off!
Wow!
What do you call that?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
This place is a trip.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
How you doing, Brewer?
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
How do we get upriver?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
I know.  I go with you.
Look, Co...
Stay on your heading, Captain.
That's an order.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
All this is for us?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Will it hurt?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
You a friend of Parry's?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
How un-sixties of you.
Huh-huh.
A list.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
I need a drink.
Where am I?
No... thanks... Listen --
Hi... Where are my shoes?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They said you're The One.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
That's O.K.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
SAW WHO!!?
Holdin' my penis...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
Are you all right?
What are we about to do?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Cerveza.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I know you're not.
I'm sorry.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Come on.
What's your name?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Can I get you anything else?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Robert Eroica...
Oh.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Maybe you better stay, then.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
What questions?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
With applesauce?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Why?
What?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Robert?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
That'll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Robert, do you mind?
That's three games to none, Carl.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't think that's true.
And what about love?
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Well...
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Not now, I'm busy
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
You know somebody around here?
So what you think of me?
How you treat them?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Come down!
Wussup?
Where you goin'?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?
How does he look up close?
You here to see somebody?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
No.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're lucky.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
So what do you figure?
For sure?
The two surfer boys?
Can I get you something?
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Has he?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Only if you promise not to return me.
Did you hear something?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Did you say cops?
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Why do you keep doing this?
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
I really should change.
Lunch...
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Why'd you let me in?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Who.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
What's wrong, Gail?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
They just left, sir.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
One.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
The door was unlocked.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Two...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
How could you call him?
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Yes?
Now that we've broken the ice...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Did she tell you anything?
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Spunk, come back...
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Ford, you were right!
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
I can't kill this kid's father...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
I tried to help you...!
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
It doesn't have to be like this?
I'm still the king!
How nice.
So...
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Got a wife named Angie.
Where are you?
What's your name, asshole?
What?
Did you pick up the car?
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There's nobody like that on six.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
You want the red or the white?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Same car.
Pass.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
No, I don't.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
How about a little of the King?
How was your tour?
Butch called.
He did.
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Okay, start pedaling.
You ready?
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
You call your son Little Chief?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
29 years...?
That's impossible.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
No, not yet.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Murdered?  Why?
What kinda twisted animal.
What are you talking about?
I'll warn them.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
John, you still there?
You all right?
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
What?
I got it.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Huh?
You're not looking too good.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You used to be on the job?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
What're you gonna do?
What're you doing?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
It's dark down there.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Derek... stop.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
And, what about us?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Please... be cool.
I don't see anything.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Is that all you found?
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
What it is?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Which is?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
I'm kind of busy right now...
What do you want?
Everything going okay?
What's the problem here?
Hello...
Tell me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
I'm literally going to kill you!
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Well...how do you feel?
What murders?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
But I thought...
Christ...where's Rennie??
Dear Christ...
What are you doing in here?
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What did you do with Rennie??
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I heard you weren't coming.
I opened thousands of brains.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Don't talk like that.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
Is it safe?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
He carries a gun.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
Shoot him.
What do you mean?
This could Pbe it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
Because we're completely mismatched.
Do you want to get some coffee?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
What do we want?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
And you've been extremely patient.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Where's your elastic brace?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
What do you want me to do?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Game six is history,pal.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
There was a review.
And he has finer moments now and then.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You're a clergyman.
That was lucky.
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
You're an ambitious man.
You've done me a great service.
Do you find me stubborn?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
You mean a general strike?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
You're an extraordinary man.
Assuming we are in agreement?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
That's the last.
How often do you test, Director?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
It's about the Director.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
A day or so.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
They'll recognize me.
You really had other offers?
Where are we going?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
Hello?
How the hell did you get here.
Thank you.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Yeah.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Why are we leaving?
My medication.  I left it back there.
What is it?
What are you doing?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
You gotta be kidding.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I'll take care of my end.
That's your problem.
I'm in a hurry.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
We'll try again.
You okay?
You go out much?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's just been a while.
Wait... give me a minute.
Why are you laughing?
That doesn't hurt.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Why didn't you tell me?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
A man helped me open it...
He must have.
How long ago.
When we had trouble before it was different.
What do you want to do?
You've got it all figured.
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Only one car.
Where are you going?
I want to say something.
No more about Beynon.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Yeah.
Are we going to make it?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Chicago.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
What do you have in mind?
How was that?
Sure am.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
You can trust him...
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
A couple of weeks back.
What did he say?
How'd it happen, then?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Address?
She's nothing to do with me.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Do you?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Yes, while he was here.
And what was that?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Tell me about the girl.
Was it Albert?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Now tell me the truth.
And you didn't know her last name?
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
What you having, Jack?
See you later.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
I'm staying with a friend.
Are you a traveller?
Will this do?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
What'll they do to him?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Not suede boots!
What's that?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You did?
They did.
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It is.
It's not.
No.  That's absolutely right.
For some sales pro...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You build it!
Should do something to them.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
How many leads have we got?
You haven't talked to him.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Did you?
Did I say that?
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Oh, yes, George.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...you don't have to come in...
That's ridiculous.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
It is dead.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Thieves.
Oh, God, I hate this job.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
I don't know, George, why?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Moss...Who told him?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...I only...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Alright.
I wish I could.
That's alright.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Yes.  I hear you.
Excuse me...
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You robbed the office.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
Abso...
I've got the check...
You did that?
Shit.
Fuck you, Dave...
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
My wife told me to look into...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Home...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
What?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
I don't understand.
She wants her money back.
No, Jim.
Guess what the Machine did?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
You closed him yesterday.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Three?  I count two.
We had a slight burglary last night.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Did you like your party?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I can help you.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Then why do you come to me?
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Would you like some?
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Hello?
Rocco!
Goddamn it, where were you?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
Where's my brother?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
And Kay...she's all right?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
What's up?
Yeah, but don't worry.
You're right.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
This committee owes an apology!
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
How's the baby?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Why too late?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Where can we talk?
You said you were Klingman.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
There are still things I have to do.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Are we going to eat or what?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I'm not married.
You're sure of that?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
It's not what you think.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Good morning.
Or would you prefer a beer?
These are your paintings?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
No.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
I never thought you were.
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
Is that really her?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Storm's getting worse.
You are much too human.
Why?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I can undress myself, thank you.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
What are you doing here?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
Who was that at the door?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
This is the studio where I paint.
Yes?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
Mr....Kay?
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
A boost. A big boost ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
I know you --
And this has what to do with me?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Where you been, anyway?
What's the matter?
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
You look good...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I know...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
You can handle it?
You don't think so, huh?
I've missed you, man ...
You want me to buy her?
Now what -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
What's with the look?
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
And you got some Italians -- ?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Hey.
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Slip it in ...
Unlock your button ...
Now... I'm in ...
What are you doing... ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
The hard part ...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Some crew you got ...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Okay, then... Otto?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
What did you hear about that thing?
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
Then you're safer in here.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Don't worry about it.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
I gotta go home.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
The third store down.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Thanks, Chuck.
How's the woman?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
How'd you know where to find me?
Is this a bad time?
Okay.
WILL!
Come on, Will...
Chuck, let's go.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
--that?--
Shall we start the, uh...
I told you to cooperate with these people.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
So who won the bet?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You're here quite a bit, then.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Oh, that's nice--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
Sean...
Do you know when you'll be back?
You're getting defensive, Will.
Yeah, I read those.
Yes, I do.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
Why not?
They could see that I meant it.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
Gotta go with the belt there...
Oh, I know.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
You grew up around here?
How was that?
Yeah.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Why do we always stay here?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Do you play the piano?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Why not?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
You doin' the hirin'?
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Kinda pie y'got?
Women?
Can all of you work?
Deputy sheriffs.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
No, I never. What?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
They're all gone--or dead.
She's settlin'.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Goin' far?
I never asked you!
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
How 'bout Granma?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
We gonna live here?
How 'bout it?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Look, Ma!
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
Looks like you done it.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
What is it?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Sure. Good-by.
Yeah?
You can have this for ten cents.
Which ones?
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
But what does *that* prove?
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
You do not.
You do not.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
What's your business?
Are you going to the reunion?
...About five years now.
I was leaving.
You kill people. 
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You know where I live?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Do you like the people you work with?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Like a union?
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Hello, Bob.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Well?
He's falling for her. Look at him.
They were very upset.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I have scruples. Next.
Don't forget your identity.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
You have a headache?
Of course you will.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
I have to get my head back into my work.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
You okay?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
He's beautiful.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Why don't you go lie down?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Started what?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Great!
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
What about Grace?
I'm sorry.
Aw... that's so sweet.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
When are you coming home?
I miss you, Annie.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Yeah, what?
Yes?
It's so cruel.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Frank's a good man.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Ha...
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Don't you go to school?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I can't... not yet...
It's warmer than I thought.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
What are you looking at, young man?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Secret Service!
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Let's keep her.
She's rabid, but cute.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Hold on a second!
Ta-da!
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
And what's he do?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
What did we learn in school today?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Shit! Come on!
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Two days.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
I'm Crash Override.
Yeah.
Your slave?
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Shit!!
Ready?
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Good.
You're welcome.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Never fear. I is here.
Die, dickweeds!
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Any questions?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
What is it? What's wrong?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
When did you find this out?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
Who's that?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
How do we look?
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
Four plus Myers.
Yes.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
What the hell did this?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
We'll hear sirens soon.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You won't come on too strong.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Get the outside shutters.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Its true, Sheriff.
Oh Christ. Doc...
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Where's that Deputy?
Where's the radio?
How's it powered?
It's over.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
He was standing right here.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Yes.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah, sure.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
They could be.
Can we watch the monster movies?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the bogyman?
Laurie, you come with us...
Yes, she is.
I've given them his profile.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Thorazin.
I couldn't if I tried.
...any sister talk?
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
I love that.  That's my type.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, I live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
You're Holly.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
It's really sad.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Now I ca-can't remember.
And it's just in one ear?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Hi, Dusty.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Yes, but you name names.
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
No!  No...
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Oh!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Lee... uh...
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Lee...
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Where're you going?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Oh, Mom!
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Hmm?
Elliot lusts after you.
What's the problem?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Like what?
Why?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Look at this guy.
N-n-no, not that.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
I know, I know.
Go right over there.
Gee.
I want to experience childbirth.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Ohh?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
Oh, Hannah!
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Yeah, can you believe it?
I know, no--  I know.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You're crazy!  That's not true.
My script?
Oh, so loosely.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You're okay, though, huh?
Oh, I'm fine.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, God!
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Thanks.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I can't think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
We could skip the Gavotte.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Evelda Drumgo.
What's new onna street?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
...nightmare.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
..It won't be long now, sir...
You give me whatever I want...?
What would <u>that</u> be?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
No, no, of course not.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
I'm an orphan.
I said how's your baby...?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
...yes.
You know America?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.... yes...
Make them eat the figurine.
No, I don't get you...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
Indeed we were.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
The girl could use some help.
...which of us is free...?
...when I... 
You should get Married.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Fine, thank you, but
I don't understand.
...my love...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I know where he is.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
What're they on about?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Tell me why...?
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
My encounter.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Freeze!  You're busted!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight, Jasper.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
What in the hell did you do that for?
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
And your worst enemy.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Mute!
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Do you take German?
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
You can be so immature!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Is it sleeping, dude?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
What now?
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
 Got an A, Mum!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Can I go now?
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
What does old Stew want?
Look, Mother!
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
Hello!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I shall call him Diello.
John has fallen in love with me!
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
What did you just say?
What's wrong, Trev?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
You win! Okay pull over.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Hey buddy!
Do you know where you are?
What's under that sheet...?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
-Tawny.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Nothin'.
Bill, I...
Bill, listen...
The homeless!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
"A little mistake"!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Give it here, Bernard.
So where are all your toys?
Where are these toys of yours?
Are you being helped, sir?
Any particular brand?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
As long as you keep remembering why.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Do you do washing machines, too?
What happened?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Thank God.
Whew.
Neil -- what --
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
His secretary just confirmed.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
What?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Lieutenant?
This ties in with Nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
Detective Bedsoe.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
I stood up first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
Agreed.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
Yes.  How did you know?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
You're hurt.
I don't have any answers for you.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
You didn't answer my question.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Why not?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
What now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
What'd you find out?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Bullshit!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
I have to tell you something --
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Ow!  Shit!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
You gotta pee?
What do you want?
I can't go without Thomas.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Is something wrong with Jane?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Sounds like you know the job.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
Let it go, Captain.
Chief, Mikkelson.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What are you people going to do?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Is my daddy okay?
I think so.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Please, I don't use guns.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The United Nations are still here.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Where are my supplies?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I committed no war crimes.
You fucking see that!
Great, I really need a shower.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
What do you want?
Our cards, please.
You have our cards.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Was there blood?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Thomas wants advice?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
They do not have your connections.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
I have a confession. When we met...
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What does it matter.
I have to stay.
We are almost out of water.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Can I have your name again?
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
That is why they call it coach?
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
How much beer?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Oh, for chrissake --
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
There must be some other way out.
Excuse me?
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
You said that was an accident.
What is it? What's in there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Thanks.
Why not?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
Good point.
Price!!
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
Please! Something! Oh-God!
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Please! I need your help.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Won't do any good.
And you think it's in there?
There is something very not normal going on here!
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Damn it.
We don't have proof of that.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
By freeing them.
Are we leaving mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
She says she's lonely...
What's he doing daddy?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
But do you agree with me?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Are you all right?
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Where did you find this?
What do you mean?
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Wha .... ?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
What?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
How have you ... ?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Every day.
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
You gonna buy?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yes. 53
Yeah right.  Look ...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
You got about five minutes and change.
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
We're going in from the ground floor.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Welcome back to Vinci.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
I was the Warden?
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
-- and she's dynamite!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
What a horrible little person.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
You're from Muncie?!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
I'm sure I --
Sid found me the icepack.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...Huh?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...You son of a --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I filed it yesterday.
Muncie.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...Geez.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...It is?
Sir?
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...Who let you in?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Ya don't say.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
He don't look wise.
Hello, Niagara.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But, Mrs. Rand --
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Can't I take it for you?
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You want that?
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
An accident at the mill?
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
That this was going to be a key party?
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
See you.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Yeah?
Huh?
Fascist!
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
I saw you on your bike today.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
How'd you know?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Forget what?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
How can you do that man?
What do you mean?
Awesome sleet and rain.
No candy for me?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Geometry?
You get in trouble?
Charles.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Hey Wendy.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Who's playing?
She your only sibling?
How much closer would you say you were?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
So?
You know my plan of action.
No way.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
I'm not expecting anyone.
Since grade school.
I don't know.
Down at the station?
No.
I told you that was an accident!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
Who made us what we are?
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
But why?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Don't Louis --
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Why does he call you that?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
The ship is sailing wihout us!
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
You know her?
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
This is no performance.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
They would have killed you -
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You're sure?
Take him.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Have you ever been caught?
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Why do you do this Lestat?
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
I have to go now Lestat...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
How did you do that?
What about coffins?
No... it can't end like that...
Yes.
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Listen to me. He's here.
I want off this island.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I thought you were out of town!
Say yes.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Oh!
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
No.
You get any sleep at all?
Let him go. I believe him.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Julie?
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
The shower again?
This was not my idea.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Is there a problem here?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You stumbled into my hiding place.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
They were cut loose.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
We will see who is the first to die.
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
You are fortunate in your father.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
What if he is?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
Woman, what are you doing here?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Theodosia.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
There is something evil about her.
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Theodosia --
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
By letting me help you.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
You know where he lives?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Who is it?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Well, sure I do.
Today, over at the house.
It will?
Hee-haw!
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
George! George!
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Where are you going?
Holy mackerel!
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Pop!
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Made up your mind yet?
Uh-huh.
If I told you it might not come true.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
When did you get back?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
George Bailey lassos stork.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
Come on, you guys.
Great!  Find one for me.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Why not?
Loser sails home alone.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I thought you said she was going with us?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
How long ago?
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
You're too close.  Back off.
Where to?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Because.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
There is nothing to discuss.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Where the hell were you?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Sean's awake.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
I know what you're going to say.
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What is it?  What's the matter?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Can I go swimming?
What's wrong?
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Mike!  Are you going out?
Get a dance yet?
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Maybe it's gone.
The wind drift is lateral.
Mmmmmm.
Be careful....
What's the lighthouse?
I thought you were grounded.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Heading back?
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I think we got a couple of live ones.
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
It's Miller time!
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Yeah.
You called, Doctor?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
No, we'll go through here.
Honey, what is it?
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
Come on!
Nobody told me.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Like hell!
I want that shark alive.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
He's big as a bloody bus!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
When did this happen?
Give me a ride?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Isn't this fun!
Take it up!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Make sure you put this back.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Took it this morning.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Daddy, why can't I...?
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Off....
Close the door.
Where's my mother?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Michael!  This thing working?
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
That hurt....
We don't want any....
A big one....
In a minute....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
You could teach...You could....
I enjoy his company....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
You look tired....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I can't....
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I borrow it without telling him....
I'll get it back next time.
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What happened?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Stop farting around....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
I stuck them on, man....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
I don't know shit about electronics....
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long?
Who?
What about Carla's gig?
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Who grows more beautiful....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Did you bring it with you?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Not for me ..
What does that mean?
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
You believe me, don't you?
Did he shut you down?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
What is that?
How do you know her hair's black?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
Vehicle references.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Are you wearing a uniform?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
You know? How do you know?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Yeah, I guess I do.
You think he still loves her?
You think John would like it?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
This can't be happening to me.
I just heard.
Listen to me!
Oh Jerry.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
No no...
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh no.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
... light.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Beer okay?
Truth?
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Well.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
I don't like to give up.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's coming over.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Forgot your keys --
Oh, thank you.
Not right now, Jerry.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
No, I air-dry.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Beautiful.
Oh, tell the story.
Gorgeous.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
Jerry --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Her new boyfriend.
Sorry.
It's not safe.
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
What?...WHAT!?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
PAUL!
I don’t know.
Eric!
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
ALAN!
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Anything good?
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's hard to believe.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Billy!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You hear something?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Resentful.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No.
Lava?
What are they?
Something's wrong.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So that others would know about this place?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Oh, God.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Give it more morphine!
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
What?
Phones are out too.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Okay, who's the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Oh, shit.
- - like birds - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
No. We can't.
No.
That's right.  Will break through.
And scary.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Hola, Juanito
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Why not?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Go, go, go, jump!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What?  What can we do?
Can't you stop these things?!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
All night?
What's that?
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Well?
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
That's not true...
Mister Biller?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Three.  Where's my client?
What are the charges?
You think that's going to work?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He wets the bed?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Oh?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Cute waitresses?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Uh-huh...
See this?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
What's that?
Ten minutes...
We're down to seven minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
I read the one about the penal colony.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Did you see him?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Hello again.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
... Why take me into your confidence?
That's <u>mad</u>.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Where do I charter a boat?
Can you fly?
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Give it back!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Did you fear for your life?
What's that?
Why? She's a junkie.
-- May I? It's so --
I do not love him.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What is it?
Why?
Honest?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Can't you get him?
He never told me.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
It's kind of late.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I called Trina.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
Then, close the case.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
I can't follow you.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Town Police.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Well?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
What does?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
On earth.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
I'm sorry.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
I'm sorry...
See you in the morning light.
Yes?
Is this really your desk?
Is that really your chair?
Did mommy ever see this?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
And how did you find his work?
A heavy drinker?
I don't recall.
I was not a failure.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I'm not taking him with me.
How's the new job?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
I've seen him.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
You're sure?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Mama, my story.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
I will buy them for you.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Dalai Lama.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Your father had been very sick.
This many?
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain chooses not to.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
I want to go down there.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Yes.
You, kill me?
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
You killed him.
Why are we landing?
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
And what would he do come winter?
Around here.  Yeah.
Jesus Christ!!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Was he a good man?
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
He never said "go".
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
And how would we neutralize him?
Kelly Scott.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
He thinks they're what?
You okay?  Kelly?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Really--
Calm down.
What?
It can't work.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
We set?
Yes.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
You're sort of a rude person.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
What?
Hey!!
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Hank?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Should I?
That's not what you came to say.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
No. He won't come after me.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"- every day."
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
What would it take?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
And the questionnaire...?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Ahhh... Why?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
They all were.
Go, Doctor.
The death of my father.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
On what basis would they reject him?
He kills w-
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Where were you going?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
What...?
Yes, miss.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Where will we go?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Some say that's the way of it.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
What?!
How long?
Where do we go from here?
I don't understand!
Any powder?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
What happened to you?
What a place for them...
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Yes.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My colors?
Qui vive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
You mind if I take a look at this?
What's wrong?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
They found this?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Be careful with it.
Doc eat already?
No way...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
How's astronaut training?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
We're on backup air.
Excuse me, sir...
No!
Charge set?
How do you feel, DeJesus?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
You got money in this tub?
Personal effects...
If he had his blinkers on--
You let him get away!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Getting some food.
How far away is she?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Are you sure you saw something?
It saw us!
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
Well?
I thought this was a pub.
Like what?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Is he on his own?
It's not him, Dad.
Yeah?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Invitations.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
What the hell are you doing here?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
That's if I want to see you.
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
You jerk--
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
That makes it okay?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
That isn't true.
And what did she do?
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed, Private.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Charley Wade.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
A .45--
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What's that for?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
I'm not picking it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
No. You?
Come on in--
You've been in this house for a while?
My mother said he never asked about--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
So how come you got into all this?
Dad--?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Something like that.
What?
Cliff--
So where does that put us?
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
This girl has a child?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
No.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
And Buddy was one of them.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
He squeezed money out of you?
No. Is he sick?
What?
What's she singing about?
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
How come it feels the same?
Like your story is over.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
You're out early.
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
How come you don't took familiar?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
How much?
You ever been married?
Take a look at this.
Hokey enough for you?
D'Amour.
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Who did this?
Death.
If you've lied to me to me --
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
He's with us...
What's the connection?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Are they treating you okay?
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
What then?
It's okay.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Valentin?
Sure.
Are you finished with me?
Trickery and divinity.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Are you sure?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Are you satisfied now?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
She has no real grip on reality.
Hold on.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Look, Ma, no wires.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Oh yeah?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
He did something with the ground.
One question.
Have we met before?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Swann?  What are you doing?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
What do you do?
Hi again, how's it going?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
Charlotte, who?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
No, its easy.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Oh.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
But, I'm mean.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
I know.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Four.
You think so?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I'm going to miss you.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Lydia?
Yeah, its really different here.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
I don't know what to do.
See you later.
Do you think it's done?
Will you please stop smoking?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Lauren?
I missed you.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
What're these?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Is he going to be okay?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
What is it?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You fucking bastard.
You raised me, like a son.
Father, please don't die.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Well I know he's come here before.
May I help you?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
What?!?!
Do you know your parents' blood types?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Nothing yet.
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What about after?
What can I do?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
How much time do we have?
Hello?
Maya?  What do you mean?
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Thanks again for everything.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
So what do I do?
That's not it.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Okay.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
Can I take your coat?
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
You might be the only one with a job.
I found you someone.
You shoot like a girl.
Thanks.
What's that?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I want to ride my own bike.
So?
What?
Way to hoop.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
You don't look half-bad.
Guess not.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Why?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I can't be nice to a fan?
So how about a little one-on-one?
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Who was that?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
You don't think so?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
You visiting?
Like what?
So why'd you give up ball?
I'll play you.
So?
We should head over.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Yeah.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Still the man.
You scared me.
Quincy, please...
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
I just told you.
What are you doing here?
Lucky kid.
After five years.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
What kind of Cancer?
What do you want? Why are you here?
I don't wanna talk to you.
No.
No.
ok.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
This is my job.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
It's fine.
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
You live alone?
What's your name?
-- what kind?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
It's ok --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
I have love.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I'm sick.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
Braces?
Yeah.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
I would just want to clear some things up:
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Yeah.
Where are you from originally?
Does you mother still work?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
They wouldn't?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
How long...you think?
He's in here --?
I am calm.
I AM CALM.
I live alone.
--- What was that?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
What the hell is this Marcie?
You look great.
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
I can't fuckin' do this.
Come home soon after the show.
How do we do this, then?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Just once.
I love you so much.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
...Jimmy...
Yes you do.
I'm Bob.
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I can't.
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
You coulda been in front --
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Mother -- ?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
We must stop him!
Aramis, this will never --
But --
He seeks redemption.
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
We go someplace dangerous.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
D'Artagnan, unready?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Die?  What...?
It's been too long.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Food, moron.
What number did you tear out?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
What can I do for you?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
You mind if I ride with you?
You can cut the shit, asshole--
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Let's roll -
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
What's this?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Alright, where is she?
Where is he?!!
So where are you from?
Mind if I turn out the light?
Why did you set me up?
What exactly did you see?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
And what did you do?
I had it all on tape...
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Where am I going?
Long gone, huh?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Run it.
Tell me now.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
You got the message Lecktor called...
He's a very shy boy...
Will?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Will...?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
When do you need it?
Ride with me.
How did you come to Gateway?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
No. Reba...?
Who is it?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's right-handed.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
What disadvantage?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Pictures?
What were the yards like?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I don't believe in God.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Sitcom...?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
What was that all about?
I can't move my arm.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Ten.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
And all this will be for real?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
How can you be so casual??!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Give me the book.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
"Burlesque"?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Is he in his room?
Why is he saying these things?!
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Who is it?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Five.  Since I've been here.
Yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
Hello?
Morpheus...
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Do you still want to meet?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This isn't real?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Got it.
I'm going to make the call.
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
What's funny?
From what?
God...
Should I be?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What are you doing?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
What are they doing to him?
Which way?  Which way?
Operator.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
What are your plans?
Riverdale.
Well, we want good stuff.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
May God be with you.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Look at her.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Don't come any closer!!!
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
You getting out too?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Charlie, this is business.
Where's the rest?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
You know why...with my parents.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
I'm sleepy.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
Look who's talking.
His wife?
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
Have you got a minute?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
What is this?
Oh, the goddam party --
I wasn't going to say --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Well... goodnight.
I didn't say.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
It's going to be great --
I'm all excited --
Yeah, something he goes by --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
Mind if I throw up?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
That's it?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
You're overthinking it --
Well, I guess he's found one.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
But I didn't mean to do it!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
Don' need you okayin'.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
The Board is waiting.
How long you here, Joe?
Black.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
What are you doing here?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
'Big'?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I've got plenty of friends.
Joe --
She's in a great deal of pain.
Why?
No.
Almost.
Yes?
You're here?
Well -- I --
I'm still here.
That's it?
No --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
Well, thank you for letting me know.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Okay.
Why did you go to the hospital?
You were just curious?
What way would you put it?
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm not hungry.
'Spooning'?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Then what is it?
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
Okay.
Not exactly.
Yes.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
It just occurred to me --
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
What do you mean?!
Where are you?
About what?
'The one' to do what?
I'm sorry --
What question?
The 'question' --
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie?
Good morning, Dad.
Drew's aboard?
I don't like to interfere.
Not my birthday again?
Don't get carried away.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
What is it, Daddy --?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
That was wonderful.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
This is crazy --
What a night.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Nothing lasts.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
No, it was so right it scares me.
Why?
39.
47.
That's it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Why?
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
How do I know he did that to you?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What happened?
How?
Yes.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
How can you read that again?
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
This is your car.
What the hell you want to go there for?
Why?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
We've got to get him out of here.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Who the fuck are you?
Prove it.
Why's that?
She has no idea who I am.
Why?
Like what?
I didn't sell -
Envelopes?							    *
How do you know him?
What's wrong?
No, you won't.
You won't remember!
So who are you saying he was?					*
It is now.
What was it for?							   *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
And...?
Where's the new drop point...?
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
I got the item.
My end?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
The Keys?
Your father?
Good samba dancing...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Where would I go?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
...in the morning.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Stevens?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Verdado where?
What is going on...?!
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Hello?
So what do you want?
From whom...?
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
Yeah...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
They had me from the gate.
How'd they get onto you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
And as an investment in the future...
So lay it out, my brother...
Equipment?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
You ain't coming to work?
I can tell, can't you?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
You don't seem like no fag...
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
I'm scared.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Listen, I gotta have money.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Get lost.
Getchmis olsun
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
It's there!
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Dad...I'm...
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Sixty Lira?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Where are the minefields?
No, I'm not afraid.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Get the... midnight... express.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Hishradyo.
I think I've been poisoned.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid...
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Do you think we did the right thing?
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
He was just doing his job.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Don't.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
It worked before...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
What's this?
What do you want to know?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Thank you so much.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
What things?
Did I do good?
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
Yes.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Answer me a couple things?
Newspapers?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
To win?
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
What was the top bid?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
We're due to take off.
There she is.  I got visual.
How're we doin', then?
Uh-huh.
Where's the bloody -
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
They've got a book for this?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So where did I got right?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Before you are.
Have you met them?
I managed.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Are you okay?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Nekhorvich's boss?
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Luther, say again.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
You knew about Jim?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Kittridge...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yes.  I see your point.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
What kind?
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
What makes you trust me?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
It's quite out of the question.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Very good.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
What sector's the air conditioning?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
IMF mainframe.
Zero body count.
Claire.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Tell you what?
How was Chicago?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
I don't like him.
I don't wanna talk about it.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
What are you doing here?
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Why?
Where'd Johnny find you?
When you get engaged?
I don't know.
No.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
Yes.
You don't know nothing about it.
I was dead.
Loretta.
What?
I'm marrying your brother!
Snap out of it!
Alright.
Hi.
Thank you!
That was just so... awful!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm here!
This is your place.
I'm really afraid.
Why not?
You don't want the fish.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
What about the wedding?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
He's my younger brother.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
How's the mother?
What! How do you know?
Hi.
I know.
He should pay.
Moving in?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Who was that?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Thanks, comrade.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Go ahead.
Temperature's dropping.
I'm a little cold.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Rita. Rita.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Get away!
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Who are the Britons?
Well, who is your lord?
The same!
All right!  What do you want?
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
Then you shall die.
You're a liar.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
There!  Look!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
Old woman!
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
I feel fine.
What is your name?
What is your favorite colour?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
To seek the Grail!
Don't be such a baby.
I can't.
Thanks very much.
Well taken, Concorde!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
If we ... er ... 
Where are you going?
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
She loved him.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
By whose authority?
You'll be sent a message.
Do you?
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Nobody has any rights over me.
What brings you here?
What do you know about the Highlands?
Then I envy yo.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
So...?
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
And the pony?
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Mr Brown.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Must they always follow us?
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
Should we take it seriously?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Ma'am?
Why is he not here?
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Maybe he's not dead.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Hello?
Nick...
Happy?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Something's happened to them.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Well?
The Police, then...
What are you looking for?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
The clock's already ticking.
Our time's up.
We can't reach that!
Then we'll go home?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
But I don't understand...
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So what do you think?
It means she's screwed up.
And?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
So what's the problem?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
It will work out.
Yes...what is it?
... What??
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Wow!
A car ... a car accident.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
No, no, I'm fine.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Yes?
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
No...I need to sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
I don't know.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
Strange to be calling yourself.
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
I don't think...
Rita... I know what you're doing.
What's  the matter now?
You feel it?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Palmdale.
No.  I haven't seen any.
No...
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Why should we trust you ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I... I .....
I wanted to let his family know....
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
I thought you made this place ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
When you are ready.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Of course.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
Will he make it out ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Was that the Old Man ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Hello.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I think we should follow him...
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
How's your foot ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
You had to remind me?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
People said she looked like me.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
So, what's on your mind?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I will. How's Shelly?
Never heard of him. 
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'm glad you're here.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
She's beautiful.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
That's okay.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Hi.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Hi there...can I help you?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Getting off please.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Boyfriend?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Come and get it.
It's dangerous!!
Hey look!
What's it for?
No problem.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
She lives here too?
Committed?
Maybe.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
I'm just tired.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
Arthur!!
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Of what??
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
The boss is watching us...
Ex...ex, ex...
You are perfectly healthy.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
You don't like it?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Home sweet home.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Rock?
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Of course not.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Goodnight Vada.
When?
When??
Hi Vada.
He's okay isn't he?
I found this.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Hi.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
How much does it cost?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Do you like her?
Is that your camper?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
How old are you?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's okay sweetheart.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Oh great!
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Hey look at this!
You have no personality.
Who's that with your Dad?
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Bed wetter!
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Run faster they're after us!!
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
You don't miss much.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Ben Gay.
Needing.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
And loving him means loving all of this.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Exactly what?
He'll see right through it.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I never want to go through this again.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Takes me back.
No accents today.
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
This thing means that much to y...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Well.  How come she didn't...
Thank God you were here.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Maybe it's happy there.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
I hate that music.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
You have to what?
I said, I've been real tired.
What's wrong with her.
What did you say your name was?
You going today?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Have you talked to Triplette?
That's what he wants.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You want anything?  A drink?
How much?
Where are you going?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
You must really like him.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
Nashville.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
And before?
Hello.
Who is thin?
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Hello.
It's me. What is it?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
What for?
What National TV...?
Where are you going?
I mean...
Come on back to bed.
Come on.
Oh --
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
You think it will?
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
What kind of pies do you have?
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Mickey!
Who is we?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Who's the song bird?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
You guys stay on your bellies.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Where's it parked?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Take a wild stab!
How immediate is immediately?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Could we go with you and film it?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Fill her up?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
She done moved to Detroit.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
People seen him 'round.
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
Any other family?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
I'm a teacher.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
I wouldn't have let you.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
What's wrong?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Don't do that!
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Good-bye, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
'See ya.
How about a drink?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
What did you say, boy?!
Come on, Pop.
Going back, huh?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Let's stay here, Will.
Now you stay put!
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
What are you talking about?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Hey, bro.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Yo.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Holy shit...
That's not going to help.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Shit...
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Get up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
How long will they watch us for?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
You're Pam?
Forget it.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Okay. That's bad.
George! What are you doing here?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
God, I can't do this.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Our penguin, right?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Josie, you look Rufus.
We followed your instructions.
He <u>has</u> to know...
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Come back here!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
You two got a thing going, or what?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Are you nuts or something?
You're fucked in the head.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Are you okay.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Here.
Yeah?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
Jess?
So, school going alright?
Morning.
I'm sure you would.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Jennifer --
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I used to live in this house.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Freddy?
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Crossed over?
But nightmares are the common thread?
Anything?
Oh God.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
That's what I know.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
Somebody else is out here.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
C'mon.
Hi.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
God, that's an enormous arse.
And then I... right.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Coffee?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
So who left who?
Why?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Hi.  Can I come in?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Eleven.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh please sod off.
Yes...
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Yup.
No!
Still loves you though.
Do you want to stay?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
By the way -- it's you.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Ahm... room service.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
I suppose so.
Max.  This is Anna.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Can I help you?
Does she know you're coming?
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Mister Harding?
M-m-m-ma'am?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
On this ward?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
You men remain seated!
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
So long suckers.
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
What is it, kid?
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
In ya go...
Say it again.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Wait a minute...
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
There they are!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Martini!
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Twenty-five dollars.
Okay, sucker.
He can't hear you!
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Why not?
Hear what?
Yeah, buddy?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
I wanna go home!
My turn.
Poker!
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
How are you feeling?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
You look pretty healthy to me.
How do ya know that?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Ten bucks.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin'?
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Hi.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Whew! Hiya, boys!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Your mother.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
Who's dying?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
A very large pig.
You...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
That's not the point.
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
To the foot doctor.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What?...
So were you.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Really?...
Hello.
Any night.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
How about the other one?  His friend.
Scientologist.
It's still the new year...
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
I just got a dial tone--
Ah ha!...
A Butterfinger wrapper.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
That was a long time ago.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Maybe I can change him.
So...
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Huh?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
And you didn't tell her?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Right now?
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Well, where are they?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Working hard?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mm—hmm.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
What the hell!!!
It was you, Charley... .
What makes him so special?
They play pretty rough.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Thanks anyway.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Listen, you like beer?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
What made you want to be a fighter?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
What are you crying for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I don't rate it.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie...
My pigeons... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
About Edie?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
This is my business.
Give me that gun.
What do you think?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Boy, you must've been up early.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
You love me then?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
We don't know of anything, Master...
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Oh, is this Adele?
Lie face down on the floor.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
Why not?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Ask him his name.
Do we need him?
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Jack?
You at least bring the gun?
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
And she saw you?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
We made it, didn't we?
Hello, Daniel.
What'd you talk about?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Ironic, isn't it?
Quite a mess.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Hello?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
How much for your company at chow?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Nervous?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
That's funny.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You don't act like it.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
How'd you get this number?
That's my dad.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Well, does it make sense to you?
You really wear that suit.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
So.  What's your point?
I thought you guys were busted.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
The fish?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
She did, huh.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's a guy you know.
You there?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Here?  In this house?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
Dad...
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
He doesn't even look like that.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Thank you...
We have a problem here?
Are you sure they're here?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
It's Germans!
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
Sorry.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
I got a half a tank.  You?
Fun today.  Like old times.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
How's everything?
So beautiful!
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Then wh-where do we land?
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
What's your name?
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
What else can we do?
It must of been a convincing letter.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
We're going to take you home.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Lucky lady. Hi.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How do you feel?
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
What do you know about classical music?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What're you doing here?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Forget it, it'll never work.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Oh, Charlie.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
I thought you were...for a while.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
I beg your pardon?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
This is great reefer.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
It's Charlie!
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Hi, Dad.
Yes.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
And the butter.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
What're you doing?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What will they be made of?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I came to say goodbye.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I was building a doggy door.
What do they do up there?
So where're we going?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
It's weird...
I know, Mom.
Yes!
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Thanks, you guys.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
What's that mean?!
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Client of yours?
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Thanks for your time.
There is no relevant precedent.
I'm a law suit.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Thanks for coming by.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
What can I do?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Lots.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Since when?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
What? What is it?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
They're already dead. Get on board.
Here. Make it easy on you.
What do my eyes see?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
What?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
He used that?
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Just shut up, okay?
Why did I fall on you?
Fry?
The sled as a shield....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
"God is Great," yes?
We crossed our own tracks.
A toast to whatever he just said.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
I'd rather piss glass.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
So much for your nightfall.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
The best. But we won't need them.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Got your sensors?
No.
Which direction?
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Objection!
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Scarecrows?
I want her.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
No.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Listen-
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Would you like to come along?
He's moving his fingers!
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Sarge?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Fuck this shit!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
But what'd she actually do?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
What's the matter?
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
They might think I was running away from something.
Your liquor laws..
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Bad?
What time is it?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Why not?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
See anything?
Cold?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Mine?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
I think you mean that.
Beer or ale, Miss?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
That's an evasion and you know it.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
I can't answer that.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Got it on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
So you're not a cop.
How are your teeth getting along?
The usual grind.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Where?
Mitchell was too drunk.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
What do I get for it?
Right.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
No suicide.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
What about me?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
So far.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Shall we go?
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
I thought it was tremendous.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Damn.  They're early.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Not here.
To the airlift.
To the Fleet.
Now, top secret file.
That's enough of that.
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Okay, I will.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Hello, Jimmy.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
What have you got there?
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Talk.
We're wasting time.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Johnny, it's the only way.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Got it.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
The hell are they?!
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Ouch.
So what'd the other guy look like?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
There's no way you could know that.
It's... it's not like that.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Stolen?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Three hundred.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Uh-huh.
It's a very good year.
What do you like?
Did you sleep well?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
The Rex.
I think you'll approve.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
You're upset, huh?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Real genuine guy.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Fuck off.
Edward, I can't.
Aw, don't... no...
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
You're being ridiculous.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
Edward, we've been together ten years.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Yeah.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
You sure you won't come with me?
Yeah, what?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Niece?
You'll like it fine.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Are you looking for something in particular?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I killed him myself.
Does it bother you to hear?
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
But how can you be sure?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Why should that make such a difference?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
A book?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your guess is as good as mine --
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
What? What?
We're really in a terrible rush.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You're amazing!
There's something I ought to tell you.
Who are you?!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
You're just stalling now.
Then make your choice.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
You feeling any better?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Oooooooops!
Yes sir.
Good, what is it?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
What scheme?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
But he has long hair!
Not.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Do you need us?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
I solemnly swear...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
No.
No.
What's your interest?
I don't know.
Casharoonie!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She stole some money.
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Where?
What's the matter?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I was getting to that!
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Where... can I stay?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You have something most girls never have.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
You're very... kind.
You eat like a bird.
Is your time so empty?
Only my share.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Alright, Miss... 
No, m'am.
May I see your license?
Norman took a wife?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It isn't necessary.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
No mother.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
What's that?
What are you going to do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it now?
You're losing your blood?
There's no child here.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You lie!
What are you laughing at?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
That's the way I feel about it.
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
What! What are you talking about?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
Let it go.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Call the Homicide Squad!
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Make it snappy, Colonel.
I told you he was a sore.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
Oh, is that what caused it?
To lunch.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Why am I doing this?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
In what sense were they bad?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
'Course it does.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Neither do I.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Wow! Brrrother!
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
No, Mother, he's lying...
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Are they polar bears, too?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
How goes it, darlin'?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Um-m, well...
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Rose, you don't have to.
Indivisible and inseparable.
And... ?
Who cares?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
You shouldn't litter.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
I'm gonna get beside him.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Get his attention.
You suck at lying, Archie.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Why the beach?
I don't think so.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I have felt him, my Master.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
What's going on?
I...
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Yes.
Han! Chewie?
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
What did he say?
We're coming!
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Ugh!
Yes. It's you Leia.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Told you, did he?
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I was telling the truth.
He might be.  I don't know.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Brad...
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Feeling
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...Guess.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I always knew you was pretty.
I thought it might be cute.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...I can't beat him.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...I dunno.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He got lucky.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
How was the flight, Champ?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Kiss my ass.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Nine minutes!
Six!
That's ten bucks.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
I say ya nothin'!
Ya still light seventy.
How'd you know?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
What?
What was I gonna say?
The legs must be goin'.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
'Bout an hour ago.
Fifty years, huh.
How 'bout a glass of water?
...What?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
Whatta you get outta this?
How am I doin'?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
Ya always in a bad mood --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
What kinda business?
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
You ballin' her?
...I can't haul meat no more.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
What was <u>that</u>?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Aah!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Wrong number?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Have patience!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Good heart, at what?
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I take thee at thy word.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Why, may one ask?
Meaning, to court'sy.
Pink for flower.
A Plague o' both your houses.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
This is important.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
So what's the deal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
What is?
Not to me, you know that.
About time!
Do I need to repeat myself?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
That fucking figures...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Is it done?
How so?
Nobody's going to do that!
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
Soon.
Yeah.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
So this is what, a test?
Created?
You should watch what you eat.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Sorry I'm late...
Something like that...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
What's the difference?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
I needed to know.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I borrowed that, too...
It was at that.
I'm going with you.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Alright, it's done.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Give me a cigarette.
Would you stop with that...
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You have to stop doing that!
What happened to it?
I told you, I quit.
Why's that?
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Do you have the tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
We don't know that.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You're out of your mind.
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's too late...
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
I'm all ears.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
How are ya?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
How are we going to do all this?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
What makes you say that?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Uh, no...
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Shopping here?
A lot of men come in here?
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
About what?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I'm not asking.
Oh Jesus Christ...
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
Don't you want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Two-hundred thousand!
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Oh, you American?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
What'd I say?
Where are you going?
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
You.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
How do you know he's our man?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I don't want to hear this.
Well we're not friends.
What's a Chinese heaven?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Very nice.
Hello, Benjamin.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
Put your arms around me.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
You have one of these?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You talk too fast.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Want some?
Oh no, I dropped it.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
I could get promoted right out of here.
How'd what go?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Jesus...what do you want?
You don't like it?
Any demands yet?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Where do we find him?
I do.
He is very good.
You don't understand this guy.
I'm not running.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
We do it to our dog.
I'll get the dress.
"Sink the putt."
-- It's for you, Ike.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Look, he's running after her.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
I think you'd look good in red.
It's nice that they're still friends.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Everest.  Is that right?
Maybe someday.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
I don't know.
No.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Where did you disappear to?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
To who?  Are you asking me?
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
It's delicious, trust me.
Who is it?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
You're a basket case.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Right.
Can too.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
But he saw you, right?
Becky?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
You're going to miss the train.
I love the symphony.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Please --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Hello.
Who is this?
All righ...
It's been about a year and a half.
Why not?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
No.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
Eighty dollars.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Will she scratch up your back?
It was sinking.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Great.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Don't ever do that again.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did too.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Is he there?
I read an article about this ...
It takes time --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Who? A scab?
Why are they singing, Mama?
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Where you going?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Where are you going?
Go on. Spill it.
Luís! Come down here!
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What?
What can I do for you?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
You don't understand.
I can't leave.
Oh. Hi.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
: What are you up to?
What are you hiding, Danny?
What is it?
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
How you holding up?
Oh shit
How the hell did we get this detail?
My features. They're Finnish.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Can I ask you something?
Was he the president?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You're serious?
I'm sorry?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Danny, I'm touched.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
I was trying to score some dope.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Really?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
That must be four thousand yards.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
We left them eighty-eights.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I wasn't made for this.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
Caen?
You?  Leading a squad?
What about the company?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
No, sir.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
I'd like to go, sir.
Don't do that again.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Damn fool.  Sir.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
How can you, how can you say that?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Speak with my lawyer.
Hi.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Keep it.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
Then what's love?
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Look at those eyes.
C'mon, just do it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Lloyd, it's us.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Why?
I can put that together.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
What are you doing?
You should be.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Do you love him?
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
You think you know what this money is?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
This is me telling you about me.
You will?
So you're monumentally busy?
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Keymaster?
Have a good sleep.
Sure I do.
Then call me tomorrow.
Nice one.
Oh.
After work?
Me?  Sure I do.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yes.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
I don't think so.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Okay, what did we just decide?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
How's it going?
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The guy with the Datsun?
What?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
No, really.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.
My car.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
We're full on bonded.
Later for you, Luke.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
Well, let's find him.
You know what, you'd like her.
It's not a charade, all this?
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Where are the guards?
This is not my problem.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
What are you doing?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
It kind of looks that way.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
What?
Don't ever do that to me again.
I'll talk to him.
That's very generous of you.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I didn't do enough.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Can't we hold him?
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Yes.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
What are you going to do?
She's got guards with her.
We had to have financing.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Who are you?
What do you want from me?
What do you mean?
No, wait...
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
I don’t know.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
How many guys they have on you?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
I'll be right back.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
What do you mean?
What?!
Yeah.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Who?
Four? There are five.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Jesus Gale what happened?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
What do you mean?
Hmm.
How is that good news?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Yeah?
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
You're not happy with your part.
No.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Where?
Yeah?
What? She asked.
I didn't kill anybody.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I thought she was dead.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sshh... it's okay.
Uh-huh.
NO! Don't believe him.
Yes.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Hello.
Just some scary movie.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Dial someone else, okay?
What do you want?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Then he dies. Right now.
What kind of game?
...please... no...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Did you reach my Dad?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She's tough.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Casey! Casey!
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Off the record. No cameras.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
For about two seconds.
Jesus, this place is packed.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...
I thought everything was checked out.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
I thought you dumped her for me.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What the hell's going on?
What do you mean?
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I... I don't follow.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
Is that clear?
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
Did you read them?
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
He just may be nuts enough.
And?
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
We don't know for sure...
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
So they ran our list.
This is a waste of time.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
We could use about fifty more men here.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Where's the victory?
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You knew I'd say yes.
Well... what the fuck, man?
What is it?
Slut.
Are you absolutely certain?
It smells good.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
How's California?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Well, the reward still stands...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Told ya, didn't I?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
What you want me to call you?
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Why?
That don't make 'em kin...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
They never find that girl.
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Where?
I have to cut his windpipe...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Where are you going?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
What?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Ellen.
Do I look like it that much?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
And that is?
What?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ned…I know…I know
Ah
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
We will all be put in the clink.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The title?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
No, your marriage bed.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
When?
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Who is she this time?!
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Kit
Wonderful, wonderful.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
The daughter of his enemy.
This is a different one.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Better fortune, boy.
Oh my lady, my love!
Even your play.
There is time. It is still dark.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Will you read it for me?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
My lady Viola.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
Your name?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
In the same fashion as chess.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
So who's going to do it?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Well?
Are you recording it?
That's it, then.
And you like it?
Yes.
I thought you stopped going.
I'm not usually drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
Know and love?
I think you're lying.
Hugo.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
What are you doing?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
You know we're right.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Are you all right?
You mustn't take it so badly.
So, uh...
Can you afford this place?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
We already know. All about it.
Here.
You get the job done.
Here?.
You must be Hugo.
It's nice.
Do you think you could answer that?
It was some guy called Brian.
Shall I answer it?
Working nights?
For what?
The human condition.
I suppose so.
You can tell by the intonation.
I don't know, I think...
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That's George.
-- is that right?
What're you looking for?
What?
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
You're late, George.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What about?
-- Anyway.
I know.
She what?
You going to answer it?
Like what?
Then it's not your problem.
Shit.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
You are.
Right now?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
It was after you, baby. After you.
George...
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
Don't do it.
-- gee...
-- what?
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
Yeah!
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- White ladies?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- you know better...
-- took a bus.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Yeah.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
I already said hello.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What does he direct besides traffic?
How?
George, now cut this out.
It's an unusual trade.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
But what?
When?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
I know it, I know it.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well anyway...
All night.
Sit down.
I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
She's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
What took you so long?
Come on by.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Fine.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I am? I mean why?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
-- Yeah, honey...
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- uhh-huhh...
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Good for you.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
What's wrong?
-- what's the problem, honey?
Thank you.
You seem disappointed.
Do you have children?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Jack...
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Shall we go into the living room?
What sort of injury did he have?
It's okay, really.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
She eh... interferes.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Bill, how do you do?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
No charge?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Any ideas yet?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
And you didn't see anything at all?
I...
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Jack, stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Went shopping. Why?
You booger.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
You all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Don't call me dear boy.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
You know, I just might!
But I'm fearful!
How are you doing.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
HE'S SO FINE.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
Hurry, Sister!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Shirelles.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Is there any syrup?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Three years.  A rookie.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Mary Clarence!
Who are all these people?
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Run!  Take off!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
You were unhappy?
The reason?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
The vow of obedience.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I got it.
It never solves anything.
In English?
Really catching on.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You're my Olympic event.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
You sent for me?
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Ten flights?
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Then one day they find you.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Well?
Right.
Get her!
She's gettin' away!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
It should be here any minute.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
But, Bishop...
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She's a nun, Vince.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
She's... she's a nun.
We both missed.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Damn... damn... damn...
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
No, I couldn't...
Thank you.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What now?
How are you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Must I hear this?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
My God... what has happened?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
Katrina...
Use caution.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
There was not much blood, was there?
Can you help?
Go home.
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
Thank ye.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Can I help you?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
What's in your bag?
You believe in the Bible?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
But maybe just for awhile --
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Why not? It died?
A boy or girl?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
Yeah.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You walk fast, don't you?
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
A blister shore can hurt.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yeah.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
Naw, I ain't.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Let's just go, Marsha.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And your father? Is he from New York?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Do me a favor, will you?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Are you closed?
I didn't know you took pictures.
How'd you get started?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I'm all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
A little. Not much.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
So what's the time?
Well, if you put it that way...
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where did you get that thing?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
I don't know.
Good thinking.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
Yes.  Initially.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
Well, why does it?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
What for, Sheriff?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
And what's that?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
And her farmhouse...?
What else could it be?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Are these your bags?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
What happened?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Right.  We have the same blood type...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
DAPHNE?
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
That's some nerve!
Joe -
Not that, you idiot.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Did you hear that?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
OH!
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Are my seams straight?
I'm not crowding you, am I?
And your head is hot.
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
What for?
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
We could pass for that.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
About that roadhouse -
It doesn't matter.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
No, we couldn't!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
You don't say?
Men!
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Thank you.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your view of what?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Yeah.  Real hot.
- opening of the Opera -
Guess!
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Three?
Love it.  Which way?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Is that anything?
Would you do me a favor?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
You're not?
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
What's the matter, Sugar?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
And who runs it?
Thanks, Charlie.
I don’t think I can go through with this.
Does Kat know?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Nothing.
Hey, you!
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
That was a long time ago.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Brilliant.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
I’m sorry?
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Who are they?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
How did you know that was me?
Would you grab my shampoo?
Yes.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Hi.
Oh, no. He told you.
You want me to let him in?
Yeah.
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Yes, sir...
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
You hurt, Daddy!?
From Miss Johnson --
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Ready to go, Mama!
'Bye, Mama...
Good night, Mama...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Who's Miss Johnson?
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Hello, David...
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Whatcha wanta order?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Good mornin', Nathan.
You ready to eat?
What did he want?
Where you goin'!?
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Fuckin' a right.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
I can't believe he's dead.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Mom...
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
You've got a stupid accent too.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Mkay.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Oh my God...
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a butfor?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
This is sweet!!
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
And Bill?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
How is the children's progress?
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
Hello, Conan!
Fight the power!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
What's going on Terrance?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Why, didn't they say?
I think I can handle it.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Idiot...
Barnes?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
I can't let you do that.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Do you want some advice?
But how are you going to escape?
Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
In that case, I accept.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Three whips. To go.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Who's there!
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
132, 154.
Yeah.
Like this?
He's not here.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
What's your specialty?
Business.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
What's plan B?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
You told Junior that we did it.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You're really pissing me off.
Sez you!
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Fletcher!  Now!
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nobody move.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Direction's east coming!
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Thirty yards.
What was that?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Maybe older --
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Wait a second --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Damn it, Edmunds?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Can you open that panel?
It's not sucking, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
What?
She wired this system.
Ted, get her away from the door.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Edmunds?
What is that?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
Resetting the sub.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Because when we get down there --
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
What?  Why...
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
You said something to him, didn't you?
Don't do this.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I don't trust Harry to do it.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
Still clear?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
You get it straightened out?
The refridgerator.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Three to six hours.
Doesn't say.
It's an idea.
What is it, Norman?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
It's getting cold.
Someone did.
Shut up, Beth --
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
What is that?  What are you doing?
Would it work?
I don't get it.
For who?  The fish?
You're staring at me.
When did it come across?
You holding up alright?
Don't be defensive.
Not a clue.
I can't believe that, Harry.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
She's cracking, Norman.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Missed.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Good idea, Ted.
Beth and Harry?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
What report?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
Well, we'll see...
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
I'll get the information.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Have you been checked out?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
There are only three or four left.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
I think she's going to be all right.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Are you safe?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No, this hurts.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
So what are you doing later ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm sorry, Carmen.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
He's nothing like you.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
I'm gonna miss you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What frequency ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Don't be a hero...
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Departure angle on viewer.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Then you acted properly, of course.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain, what's the next move?
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Time to impact...?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Hold station...!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
They had a pattern to follow...
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Not for us?
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Cal...
Nope.
Go you Huskies?
I have one, but they lost it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I quit the movie.
Why?
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...who...?
Hi.
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
About <u>conflict</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
<u>How</u>...?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
What happened?
You like kids?
Fix my glasses.
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Thank you.
What's the scene...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
...yes.
Where you going?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Lookit that, up already.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Ten thousand dollars.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Well, where do they hold court?
He's on the ph...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Mornin, sister.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Nice town that you've got here.
You guys had better leave us a...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
Get him on the phone.
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
Claire, when did you...
What...?
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
That's cor...
Why not?
What?
Where you off to?
Doug...
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
I...
What's in the case?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
I...
I'm very sorry I...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We're out of money.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
My oh my.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What's in all the bags?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Wally...?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
I've got two days to get this house...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
You hear that?
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
You think so?
We have to lose the window.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
It just slipped out.
I'm gonna call him.
Well, not exactly s...
How would you know sh...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Wow.  Who's that for?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
And don't tell her I told you.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I can't hear you.
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I don't want to say goodbye.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Hold lunch!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
So you're okay.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
So we'll...radiate some more?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Something's up wi...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's temporary.
Yet another spaghetti night.
What did you do?
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
...in.
I need practice.
So why did y...
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
You feeling all right?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
I don't know wh...
My boss.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
You bet you are.
I don't, but...
Moi?
Oh, my God.
Can I look at the pictures?
I really look like shit.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Ben never mentioned it.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Not yet.
They're my kids.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But really, you never know.
Why was he on Death Row?
So whaddya think?
No, you don't.
This is definitely better.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Don't even joke about that!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Marty...
What are you going to do?
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Get the hell outta here!
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Ni...
Nigger.
No, not really.
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
So what's going on?
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Great. How old are they?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know...I like you.
You want some?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
--be prepared.
Let's move it we got company!
What's that supposed to mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
I have a lighter!
What about Cooper--where is he?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How goes the roll call?
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Good.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Thank you, Admiral.
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Give that back to me.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
So what?
Yes!
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
You know the regulations well, Major.
I suppose they are, sir.
I don't think so, sir.
I see.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
And you'd like to see that?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
Have you tried the recall again?
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
No kidding.
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
What do you mean?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Who's that?
Maybe the warning system's out.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
We are?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Responsibility, progress.
No I quit.
Yup.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck with what guy?
I'd get bored.
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
A long, long, long, long, while.
A long, long, long...
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Great.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Am I fucking him?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Whoa!
Thanks. See man?
Thanks, man!
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
I know. It's okay.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
It's coming along.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yes.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Oh! Trim it!
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It was a racial incident.
It got that close.
Okay, what would you have done.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, I don't.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
To his hotel?
Go.
Hey, Pony.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Great.
For a while.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
You do not!
Yeah?
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
Tim?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Fuck.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hello?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
No.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
I know, but that was before.
I'm sorry.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Hat-trick?
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah?
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Your help.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
I had a teacher like that once.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
He thinks it could be made into something.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I was afraid of that.
You sure have.
What about all those ideas you had?
Oh, you --
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
You bet.
Her own movie theatre.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Hello, young fellow.
We've missed you too, dear.
I wouldn't know.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Of course it is.
I wrote that with my heart.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
Cut away from me?
Hold me tighter.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What's the matter with you?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
He must be quite a guy.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
How come?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
You made her a star?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
Haven't got a thing.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
But what will happen?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
I don't feel like it right now.
At last. Ultimate Power.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What's happening?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
Let me kiss you.
That makes it worse.
I'm not mad at you.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Before you go...
A little.
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I can't help it if men notice me.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That was meant for me!
Shouldnt've done that.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
There is a way.
But it's impossible.
Then teach me how.
You're going to take me back?
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad?
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me??
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Peanut butter and jelly.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
He really was!
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What kind?
Gus?
The boss wants to see you.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Columbia.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
What?
Hey, boss.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Is this blackmail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
The picture looks blurry.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Oh, Superman!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
I don't kiss.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Are you okay?
Maybe I could try --
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Where were you?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Let's go to my place.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
What??
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
Mush!  Mush!
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Artemis? Do you read me?
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
You must be freezing.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No Paris?
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Yes, darling?
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
But he's never there.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
I'm not going anywhere.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Hey!
Know what?
What now, my love?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Can I take you to the airport?
It wasn't a trick!
You're just jealous.
Is that what they're calling him?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Krypton!
You're happy, aren't you?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Who...who...
It must feel great.
Do you like pink?
There.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
I still don't get it.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Luthor  --
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Are you sure?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
From what?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
It's for the school bazaar.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
What happened to summer?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
It's like a song.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
Why?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I tested positive.
Do you have the blood test?
Yes.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
How does the family survive?
No.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
There wasn't time?
Of course.
What took so long?
What's that?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What are you up to, Nicole?
She'll move away.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Come on boys, break it up...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Match me, Sidney...
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean - integrity?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
If that's for me, tear it up!
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
I tried to reach you twice -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I can't
Do you know about the chip?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
What does that mean?
Can I stop by my house?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Affirmative.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Not even of dying?
You will.
Pain causes it?
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Drive for a minute.
Easy money!
Mom?  You okay?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Where you from, David?
What's that mean?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
What?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
What telegram?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
What?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
You were in insurance before the war.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Just let me go.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Thanks a lot.
Is this enough?
What's that?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
What are you doing?
And who was the enemy?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
I can help you...
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll give you a boost.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
There's a ladder here.
This is C.R.S.
You're the one who started running.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
What exactly do you do?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
What the fuck are you... ?
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Don't move, you bitch... !
I didn't know what else to call you.
I have to get to the airport...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Yes.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Never better.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Tell me you'll call.
It doesn't matter...
Tell me where we're going.
What's this all about, Connie?
It's them.  They did this.
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Yes.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
How long will these take?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Get rid of them.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
I don't like her.
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
What's happened...
Nicholas...
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Luke, can I talk to you?
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
You used the wrong test.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
You don't believe in the paranormal.
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
All right...
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
You know what he's really upset about?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
She needs help.
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
What do you want?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
David?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
I've never had a pedicure before.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Am I a thing?
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
No.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
You should have let me do the talking.
You think I'm staying?
Fuck you.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Edward Rama?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
That was one of them?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Steady on.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Modelling.
When did you get in?
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
I bet.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Who remembers.
I don't believe it.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
She's nice lookin'.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
I don't get it.
How'd you get in here.
Exercising my visitation rights.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Is he here?
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Yeah.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
...You are ze fahzer?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
You got the dough?!
Sure.
Please, Ed.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Should I... should I tell you why?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
I'm fine.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
I don't work here. My wife does.
...Ed?
Jesus...
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...We goin'?
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
...You're Ed Crane?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
Second chair.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
His eyes are open.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
You work here?
Not that big.
Argo!  Hobbes!
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Mbwun.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
How did you know that?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
You're not.  Where is it?
Wounded?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
What's he doing?
Why not?
Sure she would.
You take Japanese.
Lauren, right?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
It'd be an adventure.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
I know.
Let's go now.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Who were you talking to?!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
--Darling--
It looks so small.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Who called this meeting?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Do I know you?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
What?
-- You saw this experiment?
Jesus, Mulder...
Now what?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully...
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
How was it contracted?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
What are my choices?
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
Where'd they go?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Cold...
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Well, call General McAddie.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
Where is he?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Damn him.
...give a kiss to Edward.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Evil.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Wait...
He's mine?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
They're hungry.
Already there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Agent Novak.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Here he is.
Ich weiss nicht.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Why?
Who are you looking for now?
Can I hear you?
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Let's go away.
He liked to laugh.
Are you going, too?
Harry.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
That's the reason.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
He works in a military hospital.
You can help us.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Yes.
Where?
What is it?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
A parrot bit me.
Do you see what that means?
...a week ago.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Fifty yards right down there.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Be sensible, Martins.
...of Santa Fe."
Welcome?
Heard of Harry Lime?
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Zane Grey.
Hello, Harry.
Unwise, Holly...
Did the police believe you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
...you know and all that.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Speak English?
Excuse me!
You remember me? Upstairs...
I was told that he did not die at once.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Yes, it is.
No.
...this time.
Passport, please.
Excuse me.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
Hi.
So from there to there?
Exactly.
Too far?
No one follows that midrash.
They only kill them when they love them?
You coming?
What do you care?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Is he a Nazi?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Why are you taking that?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Who? How would I know him?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
How did you get the fucking number?
How have things been going?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Which was his room?
Which one were you aiming at?
This will be a different kind of device.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Not too fast.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
This is a great pleasure.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Where did you two meet?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
... It's a comfortable place.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
... Not yet.
How did it happen?
Dollars.
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Why?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
No.
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
No.
Why?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Here...  Here...
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
Tea... or whiskey?
But what brought you to Sicily?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
... No?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
What are you doing?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Assassin!
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
We do!
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
What are you doing?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
So, how was I?
What day is it?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
I'm sick.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
Cut.
What, senorita?
Love is different for different people.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Well, I'd best be off.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
What are you getting at?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
You're too good to me.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Who is Friedman?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
When did you get back?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Something like that?
Where is that?
Crow what?
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
What am I to do with the packages if...
What...?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Then find another way.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
So, what are you looking for?
Where is the Austrian?
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
What company?
What’s the Ambassador?
You sure you passed on my message?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
Carlos De Moraes?
May I...?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Any friends?
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Vous êtes Français?
Where is Friedman?
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
What is?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Your lady friend did.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Welcome to the club.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Five seconds. Then you die.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
To be killed in battle?
Do as I say!
I'm already free...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Arrest them!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Really?
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
The voice was in your cell?
What did it tell you?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Good.  Where are the English?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Well...?  Shall we go?
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Do you know how to count?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Besides, what about these...?
Prepare these as battering-rams!
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Why would they?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
"Love your enemies"...
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Yes...
My father's.
Him?
A beauty. Who is she?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Dorota!
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
What did I tell you?
For what? For my tie?
Have you seen this?
wish I knew you better.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
And suppose they take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
I can look after myself!
Jehuda, give me something to do.
But I want to help, I want to.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
Are the Russians here?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
Yes, why not.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
What on?
He's given it to us.
Play a gig.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist, you know this guy?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
I'm out, Johnny.
Then why ain't he dead?
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
I like griftin'.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
I'll take him anyway.
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
You wanta wait for your share?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
I'm not sure I know it.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I don't even know you.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You want a drink or something?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Well!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What is it? Has he found him?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You hand that over to the police.
Another Martini --
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Why... in the heart.
She fell down.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Ask him.  I don't know.
What about the suicide?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
He's holding out on you.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Could this be him?
Are you kidding?
Shut up.
Well....
About three.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
You did!
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I couldn't go near that woman.
Why, you said...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Did you get my money?
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Thanks, and goodbye.
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I see.  I see.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Why do you say that?
You might have mentioned me first.
How many drinks have you had?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Where did you get that?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
You're a fine watch dog.
Who gave it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Sit down!
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
Well, don't they?
Yes!
Who do you think did it?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
How did you get in here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Nick Charles here?
Turn the car around.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
What's it say?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
They shouldn't have been here.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
We've got rope?
Ready?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
Stop it!
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
Then step aside.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
What?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
I don't hear any--
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Wait.
What?
I don't see how that plan's any better.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Wonder how the war's going?
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
What do you figure it is?
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Is that good, or bad?
Which way do we go!?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
He's not slowing.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
Jaeger?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
I thought we were dead.
We have to go back.
How long we going to keep this up.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we should give him some water.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Hurry up.
Control ON.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
I have to... he's a G-34
I haven't done anything.
They're watching us now.
Good Lord!
I thought you were through with it!
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
Not very encouraging.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
You're in violation.
I'm leaving.
What are you doing here?
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
They're not here.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Hey, that's the guy-
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What're you talking about?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
It's working.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Fuck factor?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
What's wrong?
Which one's which?
What do you think?
You got it.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Jesus...
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What is that?
Alex, please.
I want to work this.
You touch me again and--
What about the ballistics report?
Pooch, can you move it?
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You don't fish.
You okay?
It don't work-
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
It's our only option.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Eleven o'clock! 
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
No!
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
I hope you find the figures correct.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
You say I am a crook.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
The fourteenth of May.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Now, Lily--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Yes.
Eighteenth century.
Oh? 
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Madame.
Then a little nap--
Marvelous.
No--yours, madame.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
But attractive--
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
You look beautiful.
Adolph J. Giron.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Lovely.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Two lumps, madame?
About what?
Right!
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Good luck to you, Rose.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Holy shit.
Rush her.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
The partners want to know how it's going?
We're too late.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
You're precious to me, Rose.
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
The fall alone would kill you.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
So, you got a name by the way?
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
It is that simple.
What's this?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Jack, must you go?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
It's bad.
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
April 14, 1912.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Don't come any closer.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Rose, get in the boat!
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Good afternoon--
Isn't she lovely?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Will you pardon me?
Where'd you get it?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Nice lines--
How about giving me another coat?
This is Mr.--er--
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
This is a business trip!
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
On the drunk.
How's your mother feeling?
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Where do you live?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Yes--Me--in person!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Oh, there you are--
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Why--don't you like him?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Can you read 'em Jack?
Why don't you leave me alone?
I wish I could.
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
No!
Congratulations.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
I asked where you got him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
I want them spitting blood!
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very cosmopolitan.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
A which?
Don't touch me!
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Praise Jesus!
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
You're a little touchy about it.
Just doesn't, that's all.
Always?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Wyatt!  My God...
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
There they are.  No herd though.
I don't like it.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
It's that woman from the coach!
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
Look pretty rough.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'm sure they will.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Yes -
Wait a minute -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
What about the uranium?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
It must do something.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
I got you covered.
... Kids?
No.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
- Shut up!
And what do you call this?
Blood or Dutch?
Wait here.
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
... Yes???
And number two?
And when might that be?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Please sir. Please -
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Why does he always pick on me?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
It's good to be able to hear that.
Since this morning.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Harry, you know everything.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
To infinity and beyond!
Yeah?!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
What's going on?
I could have stopped him.
Right?  Buddy?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
Woody, stop it!!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Well, thanks for the ride.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Are you peeking?
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
You are a liar!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
It's Sid!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Reach for the sky!!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
What is he planning on telling them?
How much do I pay him?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
You all right?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Parents still together?
Private?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Chill out --
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
What do we do?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
Yes.
You may speak.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
You first.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Somewhere safe.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Who do we interface with on their side?
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Great.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
What? Steady like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Thanks, Mark.
Good luck, Spud.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Running time?
Director?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Cut it out.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
So?
What was your price?
But you don't have the money?
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No, I don't think so.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
There.
Qual se tu?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
With a starship!
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
But how?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
And that is?
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
I believe I have found a faster way.
What is this?
I must have your starship.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
I trust your message was received?
No... I didn't.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Each man's pain is unique.
Spock?
Sybok.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Hi, Alan.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
They'll start to soon enough.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
User requests are what computers are for.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Well, isn't it -- ?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Did we make it?
A User -- in our world?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Flynn... you can't... I
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Watch it!
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
A User?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
New guy...
You think we can make it there?
Yori... hey...
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
That's not true, honey--
I'm done.
How was school today?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
What a team.  See you at eight.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Station wagon?
Helen's going to be pissed.
What's the plan?
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Give me the page.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Now what?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Yes.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
I'm late.
Would you say he was boring, then?
What?
I think so.
I can do it!
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Beat it.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
What's going on, Harry?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Tell me what happened?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Gotten your mail yet?
Not yet.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
The letter I sent.
Bye-bye.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Great movie. Action-packed!
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Like it?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Is he nice?
What did he do to Arlene?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Naw naw!
Yeah.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
This shit can't be real.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Is he big league?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Clarence.
In case of what?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
What?
No. No, you don't.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
What makes you think I could do that?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Keep it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I've seen him.
Come again?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Do you live here?
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Well?
It's important to observe everything.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
July.
Do you know what year it is?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
"Never cry wolf!"
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Are you hurt?
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
JOSE!
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
What?  What did you say?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Where to?
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
What time is it now?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Nothing.
How much?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Let me get your change.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Wasn't nothing.
Least you can leave.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Beautiful?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Is it pretty?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You got a suitcase?
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
John . . .?
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I shot him.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
John!
Are you all right?
The trunk.  It's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Husband . . .?
What brings you to Sierra?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Why would I kill her?
Hungry?
Nice office you've got.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
You meant it.
That's a bit much.
You know what I mean.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
Jake--
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I asked you a question.
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Nooo!
The old lady?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
I call the policia.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Now, what's this?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Wait a second--
What can I do for you, lad?
I'm not rambling.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
But you was going to fight for me.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Will he be back soon?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Hey.
Hundred-fifty.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Got any cold soda?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Jesus.
I got it.
Accident.
Thank you, Bobby.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You love him?
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace ... Grace?
The money's right here! Get the key!
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I don't know about that?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
I'm not sailing his boat.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
And I love you too.
Where ya goin'?
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Let me get your change.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Is that the entire message?
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
...I think rust.
It's for last week's game.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
I don't know what you're asking?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
When?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I'm going to go in.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
How much is it?
I'm not scared.
I'll just shoot him once.
Not really.
In the passenger car?
Did you get up from your seat?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I thought... you was an angel.
Yeah, I guess.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Mmmm pistols.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
All week?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
He's... he's dead.
A sign on him?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Is it him?
First one I ever killed.
Take a drink, Kid.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Three ways?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
HEY.
Shit.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Yeah?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I seen him.
Easy, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
What is it, son?
That fella come by... Tom.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Far enough.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well, suppose he does?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Jack. What are you doing here?
There was ninety-one million -
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I love you.
Come home, Dean.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Don't hurt me.
What fence? Who?
I was out of line.
What is it Keaton?
What is this?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
We're on vacation.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
So this lawyer...
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
You're joking.
How good's your intelligence?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Anything special about the case?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
They lied.
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
The most respected ...
Who are you protecting, then?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Miss Costello...?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
... now who is that ...?
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...four years ago...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She told me.
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
What happened in those three...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Just let me talk to you.
It's a place to live, that's all.
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Will you have dinner with me?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
But I like that one, Scottie.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Can't you see?
Scottie, why are we here?
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Where were you?
When?
Oh... wandering about.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Would you like some coffee?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
Do you know where you're going?
How can you be sure?
What are you thinking?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Have you been here before?
No, I can't tell you!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Where?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Why?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Ow!!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
My... the acrophobia.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
I've told you enough.
Out!
Is she pretty?
What have you been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
She'll be out in a moment.
Well...
The stripper's here.
How ya doing?
What's that?
I said how's it going?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
This is pathetic.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
We have to call the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Stop it!
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Sun rises at 5:52.
So that's what we're doing.
We have to get going.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
If anything ever happens to me...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
That's right.
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He's right.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
He just had two.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Easy Boyd.
I just want to get married.
Just do it.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Stop it!
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Do you love me?
How much?
Seating problems.
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Just a bit of organizing.
What okay?
What's the word on the chairs?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
What?
What are you talking about?
So what do we do?
What?
No...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Everything okay?
That's just insecurity.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
You alright?
That's a good one.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
"You Send Me."
Good times.
Where's the camera?
Which couch?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How did you know about that?
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Let me pass!
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Ramona! Ramona!
What are you thinking about?
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Miss Viridiana ...
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Are they going to work here too?
How are you today?
It's a very big one.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Ask the priest, miss.
Hello.
What?
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I should have told him.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Think you can do it?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I don't need a baby—sitter.
You all right?
What happened when he was 17?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Don't get out of the car.
What's the problem?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
How did you find out about the toxin?
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Find out anything?
Can I ask you something?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What can it hurt.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
...mmm?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...

You'll grow old.
... That's what you told us to say.
He's lying.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.

Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
What if they call him?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What was that?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
So what's the problem?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello Bud.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Where is it?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You told him about us?
I can't...and I won't.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Businessman?
But?
What's that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Would you like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir

No Mark. MARK Why not?
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Sarah listen to me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
I miss you.
What?
Fireball?
These are good.
What?
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Tell me.  Please.
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
You must think I'm pathetic.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
They're calling me in to work.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
We were suite mates.
How you holding up?
You are?
What is it?
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
I guess not.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
If you have to work...
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Wanna fool around?
Of what?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Claire...
Oh.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Think I may have cracked it.
Yep.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
"...for my father."
He killed her.
Where is she then?
See?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
You're not at the center.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
Sabotage?
What?
You dropped a glass.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Ow!
I was there.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
She did it.
We have to get out of here.
How can you be sure?
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
My...mother...?
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
Made it...?
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
There is no one here but the dead.
Do not tell me that!
Only you...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
No!
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
you're very --- different.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Too much... too fast...?
Stop it.
Seems more like a year than a month.
Rowan...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
You look a little green.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
You alright...?
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
Which do you think is her best shot...
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
And it can't be forged?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
My names isn't ANGELA...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
So what do you do?
I don't know
I don't know
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Well, what do you think?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Who the hell was your father?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
So far away? In Xenia?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
You go first.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Well?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
It's your car. These are all your cars.
The one with the horses.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy? I was thinking.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
You're a peach.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
In what sense?
I don't get the distinction.
Funny you should say "peachy."
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
I mean my father.
You're amazing.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
What about you?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
You called the cops on us?
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
You do like girls, don't you?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
You okay?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Did you try to fight him?
You mean he withdrew...
Maybe she used another name.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Yeah.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Are you crazy, Ray?
Kelly's next, Gloria.
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
What did you do then?
Thank you, Jimmy.
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
You are.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
What?
He... Sam Lombardo?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
I'm here.
Hello?
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Forget it.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Sam...
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Didn't you see her this morning?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
Know what this is?
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
They look like acorns.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Smells like a battle.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
You!!
Because she's sick.
She said lots of thing.s
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Patience, Willow.
We gotta follow them.
Madmartigan.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Milking?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Nail it!
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Amish.
What have you got?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's your first move?
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
It's all over, Paul.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Where are you taking us now?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
You know carpentry?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Momma... are they angry with us.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
From now on you'll be history
Our echo.
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
I thought you said she was dead.
Are you ready now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
That's our farm!
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...room --
...bed.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh -- 
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Dorothy!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
...yes.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
I'll be home in time for supper!
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oil can what?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, you did it yourself!
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Whozat?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
No, her dog!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
-- Ruined my exit!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
He’s sealed himself in.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
I can’t stay here.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
One... last... screw?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Where’s the sub going?!
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
The parcel’s in the post.
Any word from him?
Why?  What's the problem?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Damn straight.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
. . . That was quick.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
What about you?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Why is that?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Up yours.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
Thanks.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
But programmable. And expendable.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
You do everything Yorgi says?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
Where are we going?
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Sorry, "dude".
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
That's the guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
What are you talking about?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
