That's because it's such a nice one.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
They do not!
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Can we go now?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
So did you
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
How many people go here?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You wanna go out with him?
That's what I just said
It's a lung cancer issue
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
She kissed me.
You get the girl.
Not at all
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
We're not.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
My mission in life.
You know who The Raincoats are?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I'm fine. I'm
I hate him.
Unwelcome.
Acting the way we do.
Something like that
You know what I mean
Why not?
Oh huh
Is that right?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
When I go?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
What's to discuss?
See you next week!
Absolutely not.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The Judgment is ours!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
No?
I'm not bargaining!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Look out of that window.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
That's what it says.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Damn God!
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
My horse doesn't work.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Immediately.
The land is there.  I know it!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
In the kitchen.
I'll get my clothes.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
But Chief?  Over this??
Vodka tonic.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Yeah.
No.  I'm okay.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Watch the news?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Stay here.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll call it... tails.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Something back home?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright?
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You're ruthless.
Well, that's great.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Not what.  Who.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You'll be my first.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Two weeks holiday.
I have five-hundred dollars.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Don't speak Russian!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Shut up.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Shut up.  Look!
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
What are you doing here?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
I used an accelerant.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Oh yeah, why?
He knew all along.
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
Aren't you tired?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
What's up?
Yes.
No. I never did, either.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
She's in the bathroom.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Well, where are all of you off to?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Thank you very much, Hal.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
What?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I guess he got the message...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
What do you want?
Can't complain.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
First, the money.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
Corn-i-Lius?
You know exactly where they are!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
It means, "Never without my permission".
When is she not in trouble?
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
So, just how big was this fare?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Yes ma..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Found it?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
It's like a cab isn't it?
I thought you were divorced.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Exactly.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Been here long?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
Recommendations.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Sir!
...I can't wait to be among you.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Don't...
There's nothing harder.
What you see is what I got, mister.
And they are?
We can do that.
I'm camera shy.
Look, I don't know what this...
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
I know what you did.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
I don't know...
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What did you do with her body?
Easy enough for you.
Never mind how I found you.
Enlighten me.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
Nope.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm afraid I don't...
I'm telling you it's not that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I'm here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I don't know.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
Okay.
We're all like that.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Will you let me look?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Those are her belongings.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
What?
I don't want to.
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Three days.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
About Freddy?
Your distraught.  It'll help...
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Don't worry, honey
You're not taking my baby!
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Been having bad dreams.
My friend, with the funny hand.
You're right.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Had kind of a long night.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
But I've seen her grave.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
So they caught up with you, too?
So?
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
What???
Something wrong?
What about time...?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
There's got to be an explanation!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?
Take a look.
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Thank you.
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Twombley involved?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Right!
Shit.
Piece of fucking cake.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
What?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Okay.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I'm not saying that.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I'm fine, fine.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Hi honey.
Mel Gordon.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
It's nice.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
How?
Wade.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
How's that?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
What?
Atta-go.
Sleeping.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
How was she?
Who?
What about her?
Money.
A hunting accident is perfect.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
For what?
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I'm sorry, honey.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
This doesn't make sense.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Ga get it.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
why did they do that?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Copy, Air Force One.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Yes
No.
Good. Good.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
They've gotta be joking.
Can't it wait?
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Both of you.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I just wish it was that simple.
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Who's that, Ted?
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Let me by, Elaine.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted, please be careful.
Simon.
I think so.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Scraps.
Sure.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Yes.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Then Elaine was right.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Well...not for another two hours.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Ted!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Who wants to be first?
You promise you'll write.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Yes?
Of course.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Yes...
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Your mother mates out of season.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
What is it?
No... two.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Position?
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
See you soon.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Hear me out...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
I don't know.
...We're coming in.
Sure, Hicks.
Are you finished?  You okay?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
You're just reading me.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Indeed.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
A brothel.
You might be disappointed.
Well, what does it matter to you?
You were sublime.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Oh, leave me alone.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
No!
What does she want?
Stanzi!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
It's killing me.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Leave him alone!
In three months! Papa.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Really?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
What is it?
Yes, Sire.
Ah, love again.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
It's a secret.
No one calls you that.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well, we can.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Really?
Did you like it, then?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
I'm afraid not.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How could I not?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Who are you?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I'm too young to be so sick.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Yes.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
I'm not leaving you.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
On the contrary.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I regret it is not too familiar.
And do they believe it?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
You cannot say that!
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I poisoned his life.
Did we?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
The American? Yes, duck.
Yes, Doctor?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Is David acting strangely?
David?
Will you give me a break?
I dream of death mostly.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you come with me?
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
A werewolf?
I would think so.
Of course.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
A doper werewolf.
Don't you remember?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Oh, come on, tell us.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
She's a jerk.
Nice to see you.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
Pecos Bill.
It's circling us.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I can't stand it.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Stop it, Jack.
I wanted to see you.
What do you think?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
And what, Sergeant?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah?
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Just pure luck!
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Why not?
Why, I needed a—
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well—
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
My apartment.
Oh, yeah?
I'm listening.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
You're protecting somebody.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
What are you talking about?
Don't you think I know it?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
All right.
Come here, honey!
With what?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Are you sure?
Yes.
You stay out of this, Bob.
He's not bad at it.
Nope.
... Will Perry ...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Two.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
I think I recognize you.
What's going on?
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Yep.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
A trap.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Ho-yah!
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
Died a hero.
Mm-hmm.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe...
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Yeah Jimmy?
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Mmmm.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Last February?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I figured.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Right here in church?
No.
You do that.
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
Move you fools!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Sir?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
So you can't tell me anything?
What is that?
Vengeance.
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
Nice?
Yes, dear.
Take it off.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Good coloring.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
You saw the ad in the Times?
There was no ad in the Times.
I won't...don't worry.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
No, you...didn't?
Lucky, I guess.
Where are you going?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Yes, sir.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Jean-I'm not-
What do you think I do?
What?
Hello 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Uh huh?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Does he do this all the time?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
It's no problem
No, really. I'm okay.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
No. Not really.
Hang...out?
Oh.
No.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I'm not...
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
I can paint anywhere.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
Milo. Why would he --
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
You're just afraid to eat it.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Skywire.
I do!
...Do I?
You're making me young again.
I'm sure.
Definitely.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
...Worse?
Let's go.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Let's get him in here.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
No. Please.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Why's that?
No, no. Never.
What about "60 Minutes."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You mean -- break in?
What'd he say?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
That's lame, isn't it?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
But you said the other --
What?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
I could get it out of him.
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Kiss me.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Smashing!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Right away, Exposition.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Austin, I have something for you as well.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Here, use mine.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Lay it on me.
That's not mine.
Silence!
Yes.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Why?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Three days.
As you see.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
Hmmm ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
We want to help...!
Thanks, Valentine ...
You killed my husband.
But -- why?
'Our revels now are ended.'
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
And just what is the game?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
An eccentric recluse?
How on earth can you tell?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Barely.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Always.  Except ...
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Have you any place in mind?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Peter's brother?  But --
I know all this.
We want Mrs. Peel.
How did you guess?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Where?
I feel sure of it.
Walk over to the window ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
I'm marrying Debbie.
She's mine!
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, I am.
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
1002.
Yes, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
I'm going now, Cole.
But a fabulous cook.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
What's the matter?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
I think I screwed that one once.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
What's going on?
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
I'm separated.
Of course.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
C'mon. I insist.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I don't know.
Still drawing a blank.
Who's your friend?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
No.  I need a drink.
Yeah...
He's alive.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Who asked you?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
What, you've never seen one before?
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Just leave me alone, okay?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
Shut up!
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Jennifer.
Really? No kidding.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Homey.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have the slightest idea...
What?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
No it couldn't.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
What?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Yeah.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Engine 115, right?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Management were pin heads.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
Fixing my roof.
Okay.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
He works for me.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I might.
Investigator Rimgale.
No Marty, I don't.
Investigator...
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
All right. What are you gonna do?
How about 7 1/2?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
You've really got a problem.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
How 'bout...
Did he gots to be.
Please.
Delacroix.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
We're starving.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
EUREKA!!
To what?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Who are the other characters?
We think so.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Calm down, please.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Pleased to meet you.
How did you end up here?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Everybody shut up.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Same thing Giuliani said.
No.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you.  And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
You tellin' the truth.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know what?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
You can go now.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
I have acted as I think fit.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
The coward!
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.
I have faced that problem before.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Old fool!
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Who?
We don't know. West is dead.
I asked for a policeman.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Yeah --
The creek bed --
Can't do that now, though, can you?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Yeah...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
You're lying --
What don't you know?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Mr. Hardy?
My heart weeps.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I didn't --
I don't know --
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
You and the Colonel go back.
Good cop/bad cop?
Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
I lost a bet.
Got it.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
I don't know.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That bugs you too?
They got their stories straight.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You couldn't have known --
Nah.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Get in.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Really.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Want company?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
So you took off your shirt?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Wrong answer --
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Shut up!
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Edward Bloom.
Not yet.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Why?
I brought it.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Please. Go. Just go.
Can I take your picture?
Please?
I can.
What's your name, Giant?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Beats me.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Make him stop.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Am I?
You think I'm up for it?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
What did he say?
I will.
Can we talk?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Hello.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I do.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Yes. Thank you.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
What do you mean?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Thank you.
Leave him!
No I haven't.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I'm asking what you're here for.
Good. 
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It's not that.
Good night.
John.
What? What does he want?
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Why not?
You don't want to talk about it.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
So now you hate all women?
You...
You don't have to say anything
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine either.
It's more like a date.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Thanks.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You didn't have to do this.
You liked what I brung ya?
That'd be nice.
At church?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Can I come in?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
You gonna miss your bus.
She's around. Always is.
You need a ride?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
I begged him not to go. And he did.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Let go...
Let go of my arm...
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Well I don't...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What do you want?
In my house, you watch that lip...
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Uh-uh.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
No joke.
Anything.
Looks like you know a song.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Ain't gonna be moved?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Why she got a chain on her?
Rae...
Yeah?
Are you wasted?
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Not a prayer.
I didn't know.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What'd she say?
What does Charlie mean?
I don't, that's all.
I can see that.
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
I don't know.
Luck.
Yes...
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
You could fake it.
The cheese...
What if I chant?
I'm taking you back.
Why?
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Where?
Then go get him.
Well, actually
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Like what?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
And what in your estimation works?
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
No thanks.
I don't know.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
These aren't just...
Yeah?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Me too.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Does it eat?
You did?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Because it's not.
What?
Discreetly.
Don't move.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
Hi.
They left.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Yes?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Are you French?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
What is it?!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I haven't brushed yet.
No.
Sure.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Yes, ma'am!
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
Is this your house?
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Yes!
Wow.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Uh...yeah.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Good-bye!
And don't be so obvious!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I'm sorry.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
No.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Yes.
Gerade aus dann links!
Blow out the candles!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Shit is a French word?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
No.
I LOVE THIS!!
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Of what?
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
Thirty-five.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Yes, ma'am.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
The locks.
Then after that it's safe.
No.
I told you! I've got everything!
Honey?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Hi.
You bet.
Mutants?!
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, that's blunt!
Eve?!
Uh..he might of.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed.
He didn't leave with them.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
Yes.
Yeah.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Yeah.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I, I don't know.
It's okay. It's okay.
No, please. I won't.
What?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Frank would open you.
No, it's not Don.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
It's okay. It's okay.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
My bourbon.
Speak to me Fucker.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What?
There ya go.
This is it.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Yeah.
That sounds great!
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't know.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I'll drink to that.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's what I thought.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Frank!!!
Go ahead!
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Go find one.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
What happened?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
We're here brother.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
He got beat up by a girl.
Italian.
No pictures, either.
A bit.
He's a good man.
It is your corrupt we claim.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Of course they were. How many?
You... oh god, why?
Pee...Per...Man.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
The Sicilians.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
No way they could have seen it?
Why was I not informed of this?
I...
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Well, what'ya do?
Well, I'm sold.
What the fuck do you mean?
Y-Yes my son.
You believe?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
She's an attractive older woman.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
You think we're going to be chased?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Because my mom gets the bill.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I'll say it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Hi.
No kidding.
Yes... It's true.
Where was it parked?
Would of been nice.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Right now.
Eleven fifteen.
Did that hurt?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Roger.
Any activity?
It's going back down.
I'll get him.
I don't think so.
Oh, I'd say about --
How?
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Grammar.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
That sounds like Dignan.
Yeah.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Let them fight.
I hope not.
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No. I wasn't adopted.
It was stupid.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
No.
Temporarily.
God, yes. Like silk.
Uh-uh.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that Buckethead?
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
His name was Swifty?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
We'll have to see when we get back.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Watch me.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
What's his name?
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Anthony. Bad news.
Yeah. It is.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I didn't have any choice.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Run. Run. Let's go.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Here we go.
Now!
He said what?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Yes.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
No. I just have short hair.
Got a little lucky.
Save it for Bourne.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Did he say anything to you?
I'm sorry, Ward.
No good options left?
The sooner the better.
What do you have, Danny?
And?
It was staged?
Jesus...
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
I don't know who that is.
I did.
-- take the back -- get another car --
No. There's nothing new.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
What?
What if it's not who you think it is?
Yes.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
What is this, a game?
I was here!
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who's going? Us?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
What? The tapes?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Am I a doctor, no, but...
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin, sir.
He has already agreed to come.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace's followers.
Aye.
I rest.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
...I wouldn't know.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Exactly.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
What? What could he do?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Fix?
Yes.
I see a car.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
But I... I need those books.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It was a long time ago.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Different? How?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Who's to say you can't make things better?
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I come from a big family.
I'm sorry.
No.
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
No thanks, Carl.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I won't.
Er, good luck, yes.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
What are they?
And the other alternative?
No.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Has it got a wow finish?
You can believe that if you want to.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
Please.
No.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
He suggested I ask you.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
How do you do?
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
We'll be there.
May we proceed with the business?
-- Thank you.
Yes.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Good day.
Thank you.
Perhaps.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I see what you mean.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? What's his name?
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Oh, thanks.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Sacha, she's had enough.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Put that phone down!
Hello Ugarte.
-- You thought what?
No.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yeah, boss?
Going to die anyway.
Take it, damn it.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
I can't take him to work.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
So did I.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's me.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
Believe me I know.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
No sweat.
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I doubt it. She's just an...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Yes, I *have*!
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He's leaving...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
No. She was an immigrant.
His father's dead, right?
Is that soon?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Yes, for both.
I don't know it.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Know who I am, Jake?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Well, this is just fucking great...
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Sure.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You interested in a little work?
You get an equal cut.
Don't worry about it.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
It's what I do. It's my job.
Don't ruin this for me.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
Then shut up.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
We never had a problem with that before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
My fucking heart bleeds.
Keep it up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
I can handle it.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
High five.
No. Thanks.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Habib?
South African women are very sporty.
Who was he?
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
You mean I won't resist them.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
Leave it.
You will?
Never. Why do you ask?
I hate public transport.
It's not that.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
The debts.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Have I?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
I'll tell you later.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
I was at Beadles.
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
They've been tested.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
How?
No.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Huh?
Bomb?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
I have no proof that it was false data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Commander Powell is dead.
Fred.
Out where?
Who cares?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Oh, sure.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Ah... pity, pity...
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah?
That's not why we're here.
What're you talkin' about?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You mean until you showed up?
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
Don't look down.
A grand.
I don't get involved with guns.
Am I?
Yech...
Every week.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Girl's gotta make a living.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
The one you're wearing?
Too early to tell.
Something.
I won't be staying.
Yes on all counts.
No, I meant this.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
We're quoting Mom again.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
Any idea when she'll be back?
I'll wait.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You're also a fool.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
You're crazy.
Got a pencil?
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Tell everybody hey.
But I'll take a rain check...
Lydia.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
--a philandering pig.
How'd you get her out of town?
Easy Sketchy.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Got any KISS?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Right, slow...
What's it worth to you?
What? That's disgusting!
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Damn straight we are.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Oh, yeah...?
The easy way.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I said, I'm sorry!
That's it?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
We won?!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Let's lift up her shirt.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Not until like... eighth grade.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
What did you say?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Hey...
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Yeah?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Who?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Do you get to meet Ed?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Where it came from?
Grandma Death.
I know, Dad.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
He said to follow him.
Yes.
No. That makes you keep searching.
The good stuff.
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
But you were punished.
You've done it again?
If God exists?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Where is he, Donald?
Thank you.
I was just being honest.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
What I think is going on with your son.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
What else?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
No more fuckin' for her.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh-yah.
Thank God for bunge cords.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Yes, Leslie!
Then it must be Wednesday.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
I got a hairdo.
So? Be real easy.
All right, then.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Gladys! Stop it!
Becky was my only shot at state!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
He should be king!
Take a letter.
But you're my father -
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Yes, sir. 
I wanna powder my nose...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
All right -
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
What do I get?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
$50?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You worm!
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
The king can do no wrong!
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh, would you...?
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Yes please, two.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Do you?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
What is it?
I'll get my bag.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
What do you mean?
I intend to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You don't own this man!
Right... Right.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
...Yes, Sir.
I don't understand.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I feel much better. Thank you.
What a mess.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Oh no?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You're English.
Thank you... very much.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yes John!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Mmmerrick."
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
How is your tea, John?
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Good morning.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
No, he's very upset about something.
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
But, Father, it IS!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Yes.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Why?
I'll bring it back.
That's right!
I... but I...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Why?
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Sh!
What -- rape?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Why... should YOU care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I don't know! I just did!
No.
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
She got me thinking...
That's my boy!
Well, you ARE!
Sorry.
Sorry!
Why should WE care?
So?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Keitel Blacksmith?
How about making friends?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
I was sitting there.
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Over the Edge of the World.
I have to go...
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
Mum! Dad!
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Can't make enough swords!
YOU do it!
She knows it was our fault!
So did your father...
Not now, Sven...
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Yes, Mum.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Yeah, I got it.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You know Wilmont?
Sort of, um...
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I'm fine.
You pick it.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
You didn't say anything about my hair.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I want to have a baby.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Really? Is he cute?
This is our first "date" date.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, um...
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a bully...
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
You have to stop this!
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
I miss you.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I better do this, Stan.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
It was a mutual decision.
He went home sick.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Yeah.
This one's history. Moving on...
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
I don't.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
About...
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Well.... er...
What guy?
Tired...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I don't know anything about it.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Justin?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Hold on, Coop...
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
What about the accumulator...?
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
No, thank you.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
Hurry.
Run!
Trauma.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
Starck!
How do you know all this?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Justin.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
It's complicated...
The Core...!
Yes...
Son of a bitch!
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
What makes you think I'll miss?
You know.
Yes, sir.
Starck, give me a read.
We don't have time to fart.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Let's go.
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
But you can breathe it.
Five seconds.
No. I'll be right back.
Yes.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
How?
I can't believe we built this.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Is it safe?
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
I'm worried about you.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Five times.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Please tell me you go silent too.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Never better.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Excuse me?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Of course. Of course.
I gave him twenty.
You need a doctor.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
Hilarious.
Sure.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
Susan. What are you doing?
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Of course.
Later.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Why?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
No.
But they weren't mine.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Nice to meet you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
I don't know.
I know what I look like.
What? Are you all right?
I didn't see you this morning.
No. It's too soon.
Really?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
And they don't call my parents?
That's me, Merv.
They're fuckin' with us.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
It was nice.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
What?
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
That little prick.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
What class?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
I know, everyone says that.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Oh... yes.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Oh yeah.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Tell me. What do you want?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not where we operate.
Dobermans don't talk.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
You whore!
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GO?
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
How about a check?
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Plans?
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
They were all veterans.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
You and a lot of other people.
Spare me.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Hey!
What!? I'm not going down there again!
No. You?
Just an observation.
Well...
Oh.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Seven.
Whoa!
No bullshit.
What the hell's going on here!?
Duh hickey.
You keep that key handy.
Get something on that.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
I'm fine, I really am.
We all have to be strong, right?
I think --
I'm not lying.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Putting on my armor.
'Forgive'...? For What?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Who's this?
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
What?
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
He knows, Frances.
In my eyes, officer.
Who?
Showdown.
Dick...
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll get you home, Frances.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Always. Always.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
You can always come see it in London.
Are you an actor?
...Not if I can help it.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Don't touch me.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What happened to him?
Yeah.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Eight stories.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
And?
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
That's right.
Huh?
I guess.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
I love you too, Frances.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Just a little way.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Fine!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
The speech? Real good.
Mama, what's...
You're taking me home!
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
I'll be back.
Sure.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Stay calm, please.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Yeah?
Worse.
People can be kinder than you think.
I see it before me.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
So have I
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Aren't you?
The world is a dizzying place.
Only you.
Your decision. For us.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Is that your diagnosis?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Victor, explain yourself.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
The strain was evident.
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Tomorrow is another day.
You told her to sweep the courts.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Sure.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
You okay?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You're right. It makes no sense.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
I'll go take a look.
I meant everything.
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Whatever you make yourself.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I don't love Neddy.
Umhummmmph.
Whassamatta?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Those things can be nasty.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
One night on the town.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
Sorry, I need everybody.
My wife.
Auto wreck.
Yes, they do.
Real McCoy.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You won't let him touch her?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To yours.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
No!
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
You can't come in here.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
How do you know?
What?
What?
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
I did?
It don't look together.
Yeah, it's mine.
Who's "we"?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Standing right here in my office.
I'm fine, sir.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Didn't take long.
Across the board, sir.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
No problem, sir!
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Sir?
Get it up!
I oughtta report you.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Is this my glory, sir?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Which is guy-speak for...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
What?
Yeah.  Me too.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
That's a good story.
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Sure, sure.
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
So am I.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Only one way to find out.
Yeah, well...
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Most people don't.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Nesting?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Have them sealed off.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
You're fast.
It's Tatopoulos.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
You don't have the authority to do that.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
You were right.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
Like YOU know?
I had the shot...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Something BAD happened here.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We're doing episode 31?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
You smiled at me.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Closer?  I can try.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
NO, Thank God he has not.
Wh... Where are we?
Oh god...
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
The army can survive without me.
While they're strung out?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
No.  I guess.
No, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
We better, Congress invented him.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Detained by what?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I rode here, on my horse.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
I'm very aware of that.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
I think I heard that.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I want you to see our hospital.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Well, we must be who we must be...
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
That's good... who?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
So where's the money?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Come here, Farrah...
You're right.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
What?
What three hundred grand?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Okay. So who are you?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Where you been, Harry?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Once.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
Let's see how we get along.
His shrink's trainer.
Hey, Harry.
I found him.
Who?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
One of mine?
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I'll find you, Leo...
That's right. Three percent.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
What're you doing here?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Man, can you scream.
There a part in it for you?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
That's where you got the idea?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
'We?'
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
What?
What?
Roger?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
So we kill him?
Oh yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
How do you mean?
Don't lie to me!
There's a charming thought.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Probably didn't have time.
It's my pen name.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
What?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Collision? With what?
If it was a ship she hit.
Wish I could say the same.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
We hit land.
I think I see it pretty well.
Of course they did.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Yeah.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
We could call for help.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
And look what happened.
You don't remember?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
A what?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Better late than never.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
YES.
Yeah, I heard about that.
But I can't --
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
I guess.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
Or maybe not.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
I remember every minute of that party.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
Gross!
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Where did you get that?
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Don't worry.
Yeah, thanks.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
What are you talking about? Who?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
I said "great"...
It's fine.
What time?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
That's okay...
Seymour does.
It's kind of falling apart.
You're late, asshole.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Indian records?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
NO!!!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Good luck...
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
That's the spirit!
Oh yeah?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
How can you be so sure?
What? You're kidding me...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
And you like them?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
But, I...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I am.
She's not at home?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
We have hunted since childhood.
That is correct.  Nothing.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Shhh.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
I do, actually; very much.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Certainly.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll supervise.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Oh, hello, Peter.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
My pleasure.
I know.
Yes, the scourge --
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
You were the one who got me in.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I hate Jello.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Are you sick, Louis?
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
That's a violin concerto.
What?
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
All right.  What do you want to do?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
What is it?
Here are tonight's calls.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
I'm not at liberty to say.
See!  They are using drugs.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Oh, shit!
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
To go into business for ourselves.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I'm sure, I don't know.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
They can't... if this is Rome...
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Yours will do!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Well, we can try...
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
I was summoned.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
They're studying with Cynics.
Let him trust Quintus.
No!
Chain him.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Yes.
No.
No.
No -- why should I?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Yes.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Ah. Where?
Here? In Berkeley?
Here he comes.
Elaine -- I love you.
Then what?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I might.
I don't see how we can.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
Why wouldn't it?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Who screamed?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
I want you out of here.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
The Singleman party, sir?
A single. Just for myself, please.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
No. 
When is he coming back?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Well I don't know.
Sit down.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Will you unzip my dress?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I haven't. No.
You're welcome.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
If you want.
No.
I don't.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
No we don't.
Is it?
Not exactly.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Why are you asking me all this?
Art.
Kind of.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
We'd go to his car.
I don't think we were the first.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Let's drop it.
I see.
Are you?
Of course you did.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Where is Elaine?
Sure.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
You got me.
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Thank you.
Oh yes.
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Mrs. Robinson?
It's Benjamin.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Who?
Oh -- work!!
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
You're very funny --
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Oh -- 
I know.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Yes, quite.
A little strange, Baron.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Be quiet.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Everything?
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
No.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Yes --
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
You pay me.
I got ten marks for that.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
Have you got it now?
Hello!
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
I understand perfectly.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Then, it's all over?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
We did not approach you.
What a session this has been.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Me?
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Henry, no!
Why? What's wrong?
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
So I heard.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You don't have the stomach for it.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
That's right.
I don't?
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Scram. Go home.
Taking you for granite?
Mm?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I want to know everything about you.
That's just Lilly's way.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Yeah? How?
Where?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
No! Because I --
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Detective...
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit.
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Forget it.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
No.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
You stole it?
Why not?
I came to see you.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
It's always John.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Can't you hold it?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Danny!!!
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
Kara, no!
It's not working!
It's a sign.  He's come home.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
I'll meet you over there.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I'm gonna wet my pants.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Let's talk about something else.
First Nagasaki--now this.
You know me, boy.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno.
I dunno.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
The posies are for her?
I forget mine for years on end.
I've considered that.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
I'll see.
Everybody says he was so brave.
They were in the same creative writing class.
England?
Tell me that.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
The smallest thing I've got.
No.
I don't want to fight you.
It's your house, Dad.
I'm talking to you gently now.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Give us time.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
What a honeymoon.
You're wrong.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Hope.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
I've got to run!
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Correct.
We'll find out now, won't we?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
She did?
There was so much going on.
Jesus.
I dunno.
That is sad.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
No.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
He isn't any friend of Father.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Yeah.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Take plenty of cigars.
What?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I'm amazed.
We've got to rescue him.
Not true.
He died of a massive rupture.
Yes, we do.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
No.
You mean I'm black?
What are you doing?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
How many weeks?
Yeah.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Three hundred?
Half now, half later.
Ulcers.
She's dead.
What rate?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Who's paying you?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I don't know.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Does she know anything about this?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What?
No.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Good.
Ratan!
What?
They're all about the same. You want something?
No.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I'm worried about Jake.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Oh, I don't have one.
No, no. I just took it.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Lady! Be quiet.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Harold Chasen.
What?
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Yes. Very much.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Over there by the courthouse.
It is kind of rough.
Well, I really don't drink...
No more revolts.
What was that?
It's so blue.
Well, why don't you?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
What is it, Harold?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Here.
Oh, Harold. 
But why now?
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Does that worry you?
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Well, I don't...
Souvenirs?
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
I knew you'd come.
She certainly has.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
What are you talking...
Then why are you here?
And what about you?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Yeah.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
I'm lucky that way.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
He's just going through a phase --
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
You're doing fine.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
No. Don't --
My job.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Doesn't sounds like him.
He's just pushy.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
What's the problem?
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Who are you?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No!
You did this before, right?
No. That wasn't the deal.
It's important.
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
Oh my God.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Ssh!
What do you want me to do.
A box?
So you were cheated.
And the blood let you out?
I said no.
There's very little I can do about it.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
Like who?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
Can I get you anything?
I don't know where to begin...
It's better you see for yourself --
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
What?
Not much.
I... suppose so, yes.
Am I?
What's wrong?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Try me.
I said: I found a room.
No Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You will keep in touch.
You like?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Never better. You sleep well.
Sure.
Gone?
No. It's all over.
Just upstairs.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
What happened to you?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
What the fuck is that?
You're not even coming?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Oh, hi.
So.  Is now a good time?
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
-- FUCK OFF!
It's Vince and Justin.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Hi.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
You really believe that?
And do you like it that way?
I think you know that.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
I don't know.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Is that the last of it?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Pigsty.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I don't want to go back.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Harder.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Not really.
I mean it.
Not in love, exactly, but...
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Hey.  It's Liz.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Thank you.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Records are those big round black things, right?
I'm Vince.
Sure.
Go to hell.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Thanks.
Why?
I don't follow you.
The boy _died_?
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
You are being foolish.
No one knows you're here?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
A factor of age.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
That's insane.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in '31?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
You and I should talk first.
What's all of this got to do with me?
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-Auditorium nostrum-
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Why are you here?
It is less.
You are still so very young.
No!
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
What would you like?
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Romirez is dust.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Second musketeer.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Stay out of it.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
How many came?
And the Bulgarian?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
Leave her alone.
It doesn't.
I presume it's a sword.
A mystery.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Do you?
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
His only kid.
I'm sure that's true.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Hildy!
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Seventy-five.
Sort of a Jack London style?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Thank you.

Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No -- she didn't.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Get out of here, you!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
What?!!
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Get away, Svengali.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Thanks.
Thank you.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I'd like to think.
Where's some paper?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You grey-haired old Judas!
I'm busy, Duffy.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Me, too.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
All right -- all right!
Give me a hand with her, will you?
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I did.  Hold the wire.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Editorials?
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
No -- what?
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Huh?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Huh?
Forty dollars.
The what?
No, I don't think so.
Yeah?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
A very fine-looking women.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Why?
Apparently so.
Looking for shrapnel.
Who told you that?
It's easy. I've done it.
...and four and five...
A bit too quick.
Air-raid?
Please yourself.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
I will if you will!
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
No, I won't.
Who said anything about love?
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Wasn't it lovely?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Grace!
And now we're glad you did.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
What about R.J.?
Who's your Daddy!
I was just wondering.
You shouldn't a done that.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
OK, Boss.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
He won't move.
It's a girl.
Where ya headed?
There's not enough room.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Tickets for what?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I resign.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
She looks like she stinks.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don't doubt that.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Firefly.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Well, go get her.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Right.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
I always favored the Hulk.
Right...  ...come on.
Excuse me for a second.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gabrielle.
Oui.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Shh.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
No!
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Okay.
But I like being human now.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Shut up and tell me.
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Please, honey, let me in.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
We are animals after all.
My God! The fork! The fork!
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Nathan!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
That's a great idea.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
Of course.
Yes.
Absolutely.
A deer?
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
All right.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Your entire body?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
That's great.
I had sold my fucking soul.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Check!
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
Do we need words?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Deal the cards.
Two.
Thought you only drank milk.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
How good is he?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
I said we're leavin'.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Eddie...
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Oh no, nothing for me.
Okay?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Thanks. I will.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Eggs. How do you like them?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Is he a winner?
Is that what makes a winner?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
He went off someplace.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Game's over, Eddie.
You watch me.
My name is Robert.
Yes.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
We move.  Place to place.
My wife.
What's inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Virginia...?
Please.
You got that right.
Round back.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
I'll take you to school.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
Good night.
Why, yes.  Why?
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Yes.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
All their lines were busy.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
You have to leave the White House.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
He's not going to listen to me.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
I'm thinking.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Dad...
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
She should be shortly.
And our troops here?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
How long would their shields be down?
No Sir. Definitely not.
What?
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I didn't even see them fire!
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
Here... now.
Many worlds...
You've got it!
Where?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Lower me down.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
How do you know?
Where is it? I want it.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I came to get you! What do you think?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Well, uh...
Look, can we discuss this later?
I came here to save you.
She talks in her sleep.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What?
I'm out, Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
What?
All right Dad -- tell me.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Dad, how can you?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Thanks.
This could be close.
"J".
What did you find, Dad?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Yes, I understand.
I don't like to show off.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
You don't like him do you?
Yeah, that's what happened...
Why they glow like that?
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Long ago -- before my father's father.
The old man saw it in a dream.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Just try and control yourself.
Maybe he likes older women.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
Go!
What above the curves?!
You got it!
Al ???!!!
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
Al.
You said it.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Then I'm crazy.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Then what are you stopping for?
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I'll sue.
Go out, take your first left.
We get on a plane.
Little late for that.
What was?
What's happening?
Where are you staying?
...Rene...
It is my business. It's my name.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
Just hold them close and stay still.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
This just won't work.
I don't know!
I can't keep up.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
What a nerve!
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Yes. Joe.
And how do you service foreigners.
What about it?
Oh.
What things?
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Sir?
Nothing.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I didn't say anything.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
You are.
That you're not crazy.
Why do you do it?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Hires you for what?
And you, what do you like?
No.
What's he done?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
I asked him.
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why did you, then?
Now what?
I told you, I work for him.
...Piece of mind.
Thanks.
Just one. The back up.
Tear it apart?
Thank you.
What does he know?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
I heard them.
In the backyard.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Sure. Where?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me Wigand.
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Okay. 
Call me back in ten.
You're sure you want to do this?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Hello? Yeah...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey...
No, you do not.
That's right...
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Good.
What?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
You okay?
Good.  You have kids?
I'll call them, Lowell.
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I don't know what to do.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
What?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
There is -- there is no family.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
When should we do this?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Well, I wouldn't say --
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Triple!
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
No frown lines.  New watch?
We did not.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
Asian? No.
You have the pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Yes?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Did you see the tape?
Why would you be here?
You don't believe in it.
He wants a reconciliation.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Absolutely.
So I hear. Is that all?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
No, we're not!
Oh Miles!
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
I bet.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
What do you want?
You can't prove anything.
Meaning my house.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Hello Miles.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Please!
She did a Harriman.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
He has a reputation for being tough.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
I guess.
Excuse me?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
When you have a moment.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
We've outlined a settlement...
Thank you.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
She always looked out for me.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I know—but—
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
South America.
I'll get it annulled.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
On the road.
I'm sorry you read it.
I suppose so.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Any others?
What do they say?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
What happened to your money?
. . . turn."
Oh—the papers—
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
You must have me confused with—
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Shut up!
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
The pleasure is all mine.
Outside!
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um. You're doing all right.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Well, you were!
What's the matter?
What do you mean—starvation?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
To New York?
I don't want it now.
was—but—
What?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
Oh, no!
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Mind your own business.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Me?
Do you know?
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Why, he'll be back.
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
What's 'at?
Huh?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be—
Okay, pete. 
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Zeke.  Git!
Huh?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Go on, Willie.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
There's a word - orders.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, you don't!
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
How many shots you say you heard?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
A Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Nonsense.  What next?
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Tough day.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Well... yeah.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Take a look across the street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
The Warren Commission call him?
Allen Dulles?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Ever ask him?
More than ten years.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Yes?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Not a problem.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I understand.
Who was there for your ass?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I found out.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She almost sounds scared.
Sure.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
What's her name?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
Cash poor?
Yeah.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
It's not really something I think about.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Surprise.
What'd ya see?
I'm old enough to be her father.
I don't care.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
When did you decide?
That's my job.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
What if I've figured a way?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
In the bag underneath.
I hesitated taking that much.
I'm sure.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
I beg your pardon?
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Yeah?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
What are you doing?
What did you say?
Was she there?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I never have. It's not my money.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I thought you were watching him.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Dreaming.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Got some o.j.?
Sure.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Go sit over in that chair.
Baby, I didn't --
Talk to you tomorrow.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
That's a good idea.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
What'd you care?
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You lived in Japan, when?
Yeah.
You live with him.
And your point is?
All right already.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Did you get it?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Maybe the Feds got it.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Beaumont worked for you.
Is that what I think it is?
Call her, tell her the combination.
Yes.
I was gonna tell you...
No problem.
What are you then?
Then what are you doing here?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No, thanks.
I see.
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
I'm okay.
How do you know?
Yeah, ever since that ...
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Me, too.
Stop!!!!
Just my luck.
That's right. We did.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
But the paper ...
He told me he was going to Hell.
How long had that been going on?
No. Not really ...
... I've seen them, too.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Sarah.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Hell, you think I am?
Carlson? Is he new here?
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
No. Don't move me.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
I didn't want to wake you.
Where is the lamp?
A good lay.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Gabe.
What's wrong?
They're like demons, Jez.
Where?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Get your clothes off!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
What kind of man are you?
Am I home?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
What's he talking about?
Let go!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
I can do anything I want.
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Me neither.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Don't be funny.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
You know who I am.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
So why tell me now?
Never?
One drop?
Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I don't know what to say.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
If you're lucky.
Total delirium.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
I'm awake?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Nothin' much.
I work in a bakery.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Why not?
I don't know what to do.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Bring it in.
He doesn't like it.
Punk?
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
We made it?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Get out of here!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He came for me, I had to run!
I think I broke my arm.
They're back here.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
You got that right.
What?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Fuckin A...
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
No you don't!
I thought you meant...
I'm stuck!
I get it.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
We're screwed.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Shut up, Thorgan!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Would you?
You're leaving me here alone?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Kay-em 14.
You need to get laid!
Are there any other shuttles?
Ow!
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I love you.
No! He's coming with us!
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
But...I...400 years?
Three...two...one...
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
Who's driving the boat?
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have you ever had one do this?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
Do you see the kids?
Where is he?
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
You going to be all right?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I didn't agree to that!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Maybe we can save August...
I was acting in the town's best interests...
My kids were on that beach...
No, we just checked the beach...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Rogue?
What stinks so bad?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
That wasn't funny.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Do I set the goddam hook?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
This is Quint, Missus.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Let me see your hands...
I'm okay...
What do you see?
Ever see one like this?
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
I don't think so.
Cool.
I'm supposed to be running.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Or something.
I'll try to drop by later.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I totally heard you did.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Huh?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
You weren't even alive!
Commercials.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
You're something else.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
You're pregnant?
Tore up from the floor up?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I'm pregnant.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
They're yellow.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Looks like it, yeah.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Carrie.
Karma.
Not really.
...Yeah, sure.
He whips you?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
What's Early been in jail for?
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
I heard that.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I don't want to talk about it.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I don't know.
Where's Adele?
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Wasn't my fault...
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
...That'd be my guess.
Yes.
Yes!
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Was up bitch?
Did what take?
Yeah.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Are you hungry?
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah me too nigga.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
Bet.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
You are?
Hold up man.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yes.
Come on.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Yeah.
Because, you know why. You know.
I guess so.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
I didn't bleed.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
What?!
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Four-thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Yep.
It's grandmother style.
What are you saying?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
How'd you get in here?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Local?
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Sanderson?
He was with me?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You're not going to tell me that.
Because she's the type.
You like to brag, don't you?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
He was watching you.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
No prints.
That's great.
We're not sure.
It's important.
But we heard him.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
What does that mean?
We're going to work on the message.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I got it from the tournament directory.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Are we going to go through this again?
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Whatever's on your mind.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
What are they, please?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
You sound like my mother.
That's not fair!
You're not?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Because I think he's wrong.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
And you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Call room service.
I thought you said the line was busy?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
For emphasis?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You don't understand.
It's not that easy.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
I got lucky.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, you're beautiful.
Thank you, but I can wait.
About what?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You must move away from the Center.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You have rope?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Let us wish him peace.
Use your sword.
Each to his fate.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
He saved our lives.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
These we'll pay for.
At the gallop!
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
A small house.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
And mine goes with you.
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
A match for your son, I think.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. We lost five.
How many did you lose?
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Many have perished in that maze.
She has the power to kill.
Her name is Death.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Yes.
Why must you know?
You lie!
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Yeah.
Do you need money?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Well, I don't need them...
How can you say it?
What, for example?
Whoever.
Perfect.
What?
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...17.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
Yeah, what?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
No it's not.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
It's just a regular day.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
You're talking to me?
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
That's all right isn't it?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You tell stories?
Nine.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
California.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
What do you mean?
No alcohol?
What do you think I should get?
No.
No.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
No -- S.E.R.A.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
You OK out there?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Oh, and what did you do?
Yes... I'll give you that.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Yes.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I've been all right.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
No.
Yuri... are you...
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
Get up.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
I believe you! Don't worry.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Thank you.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
See?
Definitely! I love him!
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Name?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You're kidding!
Really?
What?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
No way --
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What happened?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Why not?
You should. Do you have a resume?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Maybe she found him like that.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
Harvard. Law school.
Thank you. Having fun?
Thank you.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Really?
It's not a Theta --
Cunnilingus?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Always.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
To finish last evening's delightful work.
But I'm hideous!
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
I see...
Or looked so beautiful...
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I didn't know... I --
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
Careful, lad.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Whatever for?
Blackheart?
What know you of fields of war?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
There's the way, mates.
We'll find it.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Will you chance a miss?
It doesn't matter.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
The wound is mortal.
Can you save her?
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
What weapon?
Where?
And did you?
That's it then... the ring!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
No, no, no... this is different!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
If you like.
I may have said perhaps...
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
I'll go search for it.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Oh, la...
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
And I... love you...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Ask away, sweet man.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Is she fair, this princess?
No fear of that now.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
You... you... you mortal you!
Be fair, Oona.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
What are you doing?
I wanna be with you today.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
What's wrong?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without make-up.
I'll get your back.
I can use your mom's.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Why are you so stupid?
Floating to Catalina.
He's got a standing invitation.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Will he talk to me?
We've known each other since grade school.
If that's what it takes.
Months.
Maybe that's too long.
That's too long.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
She didn't really say.
Thank you.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
No I'm not!
I almost saw Catalina.
No.
No you don't.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
The gloves on the table are for you.
Sit down for a second.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
What I'm not.
Nothing.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
What do you know about me?
I'm telling you now.
Getting high, I guess.
To hide a black eye.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Are you taking them still?
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Here.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I want you to find someone for me.
You let him pierce his nose?
What?
Which?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
This was my very first slow dance.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I'd rather you not be here.
What did I say?
No.  Mostly me.
What?
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The payoff.
His father is a man.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
This is what he wants.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Is Spanky here?
She got married last month.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Claude.
Sure, boss.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
But I'm having a good time...
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
That's because I've never been here before.
Good old Monroe.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
What about you, Radio?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
So?
Forget it.
Claude.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I'm stuck!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Whatever.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
Don't touch that car.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I said you're soft.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
So?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
'Preciate it. Claude.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Something like that, yes.
Jenny?
Anybody else need anything read?
Satchmo.
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
You found him.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
And he's dead serious.
What do you think about... Earth?
Urr... uggg... errr...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
So excited.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
It would be so okay.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Peppermint... alright.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Why are you laughing?
My dad's an optometrist.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
If you want to.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Are you dead?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Anything to eat?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Did you?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Here.
I'm very smart.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Please... No.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Curious.
Six. I go red next year.
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
You know something.
That's tomorrow.
You're not going, are you?
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
But what is this -- why?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
I don't know.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
What?
Sure, I'm okay.
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Yeah.
Pete... Don't...
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes.
Sure.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
What's the word on the street?
What about yesterday?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
I... I didn't say anything...
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Alice who?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Yeah?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Two detectives are coming out.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Just a minute.
Was there?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
All right!
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Yeah.
Sorry... I...
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I do like you, Sheila.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Oh, read it!
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Will you stop squawking!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Sounds like a stall to me.
Just call me Barney.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
I'll say.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Say, what about that gold deal?
All right.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
No.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Splendid!
Then it's done.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Father Perrault is dead.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Hey!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
What do you mean if we should get out?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You're wrong, George.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
I saw a man whose life was empty.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I wonder.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
All right, I'll be there.
It's not even a fucking door.
I gotta be honest about something.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Well this didn't.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Where to?
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
I'd double it and add 20.
Do his job.
In case I need it.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Actually, yeah--
I wanna make a deal.
Scientific American?  Really?
What the hell is going on?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went right to the President.
Oh shit!
Anderton, leave.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She died?
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.
Right.  I know --
Yeah --
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
We won't let them.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Everybody runs.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Yeah?  So?
Did Marks close the front door?!
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
You gonna tell on me?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Oh... Hi, John.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Uh, I'll try...
Wanna hear something funny?
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
He's alive?
Who said I would?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
What the fuck is going on?
Kill me!
I'm a little dizzy...
You say some of the children died?
The system would collapse.
Do you?  Really?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
What?
Where are you?
Not quite.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Yes.
I wanna kill my boss.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
How many?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I forgot my glasses.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
What does he want with a precog?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
See you later.
We're in Fashion.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
Holy shit.
He's okay.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
I'm ready.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I don't get it.
You driving her?
Get away from her.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
No.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
This one?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Ruiz knows about this?
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Nah, man...
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Understand me?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
So?
I know the number.
I will.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Bullshit...
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Who's driving her?
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Pretty nice.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
You sure?
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
I told you what they said.
They asked who it was.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
You would think.
Fine.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You're out of money?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Watch it...
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
You'll love it.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
We're square.
What?
Tell me.
So tell me how it is.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
What?
That's none of your fucking business.
And where might that be?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Heard where?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
What do you do with your time?
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Read it and keep on reading.
Then the devil is white.
I sure met some.
Tell Him that.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
I can handle it.
Why do you ask?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
I told you we don't know for certain.
What?
Say what you're saying.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
The sentences to run concurrently.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Please make way, please --
No. You'll be marked for death.
You hear me, girl?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
I ain't doing bad.
Tell him about Baldy.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
So what about him?
Might be all right.
I'm the man.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
I don't know shit about you.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[The what?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who are you?]
[Who ordered it?]
[Who's he?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[You stole the drop.]
[The ransom was ten.]
Nothing wrong.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I said the plan was right here.
Different door. Not far from here.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
No.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Where?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
Yes.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Still not a question.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Dyslexic?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
No.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Do you know what she told me last night?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
For a year?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
He has to go.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Where you going?
We just talked.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
I really should get home...
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
Nothing.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Goodnight.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
You gonna get married.
Sure.
I heard you, Ma.
She didn't look Italian to me.
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hiya, Ralph...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I don't wanna talk about it!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I don't drink intoxicants.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Be right with you.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
People will talk.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
I can't... couldn't.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
C-A-M-E-M...?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't get it.
What do we do?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
He can move in here with us.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Something else we have in common.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't mean with me.
You think he won't.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
The one and only.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Just in dreams?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Morning, Captain.
They can't do that to me!
What's that, Henry?
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Now?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
I guess so. Then what happened?
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Thirty dollars.
How do you do.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
The Websters.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Wait a minute . . .
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
In what man!
A deal?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Oh.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Oh!
I got it all ready. Here.
Thank you.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
That's—
No.
He's watching the other door.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Shut up!
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Well?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Nineteen!
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Okay.
Shh!
What?
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
You want me to go up with you?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
What happened, Mike.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Am I gettin' the car?
Automatic.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Roper, we're into it...
Yeah.
I've rarely shot anyone.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
We could fill it with water.
Why? You like my ass?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Do you really?
I think so.
Yes.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
To run late!
Yeah, first and second.
He's cutting down the visibility.
Damnit!
Pull up alongside.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I ain't interested in your life story.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
You heard.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's very nice.
And you think he'll...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
A deeper level?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Prude.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
What?
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Yes.
Okay...
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
True.  But why?
In here I am.
It's not real.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Who?
There is no --
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- He won't.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
The truth.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- Katie.
Her?
Yes.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Not you.  A copy.
Because you'll never believe me.
There?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Access established.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
We can take these guys!
Ryan's Comet!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
A stellar idea, Skull.
A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Wait for me!
You want me to place a few calls?
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Strength in numbers!!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Who hired the bastard?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I can just imagine.
For being a bootlegger?
I'm already late.
I needed to see you again.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I'm doin' business here!
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I told you twenty!
Who?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I don't fuck my partners.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Okay. I'm listening.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Guess I'm just lucky.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Uhh - martini?
Sad commentary, huh?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Bend over?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Tell me what?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Monkeybone...!?
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
I don't <u>know</u>.
What?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
What pictures?
Behind the books.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Mm hmm.
What does he do?
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
It couldn't be.
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Who?
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Paine.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Shut up, Diz.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
I'll cherish ya.
Well, let's get going.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
He's a house-afire!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Great saints!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Oh--Jim!
Me! Jim--how--?
Y-yes, Jim.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Is *what* getting me down?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Will he *yield*?
No, Jeff--please--!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Office of--Senator Smith?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
You *couldn't*?
Punch?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Right.
Yes, I see that.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
No complaints.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No! Stop it!
Great.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Don't mention it--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Wait--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Well! You don't say!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Go away, Nosey.
Well, well!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
He did it.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Senator Paine.
Order!
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
No.
I haven't.
Your Honor!
No!
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
What happened?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
Uh-huh.
It's wonderful.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
What's that?
Oh, that—
Nothing—
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Yes, of course.
No. It's nothing.
I'm crucifying him.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Boy, was he burning.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
But your honor—
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
All set.
Okay.
Yes.
Buffer?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Nah.
What're you talking about?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
We own an opera house, don't we?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Uh-huh.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Huh?
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Binge?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Excuse me. What did you say?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
What two policemen?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Who?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Take your time.
Why's that?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Not any more.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Henry!
Stop now.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Tastes good.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I do.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
He told you.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Sure I can, Lionel.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
You're good.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mother... go away!
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, I really don't.
Why don't you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Is she against you getting help?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Disgusting.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
That's one way to put it.
I don't know if --
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Um-huh.
I'm glad.
I don't follow you.
Hello.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
Weekly or monthly?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What happened today?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Is that the question?
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Yep.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
It's not?
Just you.
It wasn't the best situation.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
I'm honored.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
You always did have more balls than brains.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Intestines.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Water turning to blood.
I am an English woman.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
I just decked your brother
What did you find? What did you see?
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
If you call that a kiss.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Not unless you call me Rick.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
I have no choice.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Way to go, Evy.
Still...
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
I know you knew I'd know.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
I'm his daughter.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
I thought you'd never ask.
Doctor Heller?
Thanks.
Ummm.
Should I kill them?
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Me.
Alone tonight?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
Monica, where are you?
When are you going to take off that mask?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Yeah.
Because that's what it is.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Anybody got any?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Oh hi, Mom.
I always knew that you were special.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Who are they?
Are you sure he's still alive?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Great timing!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
And, what a delightful idea!
I did, sir.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
What do you have in mind?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
It is a terrible shock.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
No, sire... I was asleep.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
The first reports came in at about ten.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I'll have the fire built up.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
No.
Yes.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Yes.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Yes, I wrote it.
I know.
Yes?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Yes, sir.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
That's it?
Don't move me.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
I'll do it.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Black magic.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
What you mean, so?
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Sorry about today, man.
No, man, just wait.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I don't know.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Well bring yo' ass on...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Have you seen Day-Day?
I saw it.
Nice to meet you?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Ya'll live around here?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
Keep pushing.
I'll take you later.
Take your car.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
I threw my back, again.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
What's he doing here?
What happened here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
That's my girl.
What?
Huh?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Then I have time for a drink.
I want'to talk to her.
No, that's,..that's fine
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
Nods.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Keep it.
What?
What are you supposed to do?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Thank you.
Thanks for the tip.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hm!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Yes, Dad.
I been mindin' Pearl.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How do you mean?
Walt!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
A man of the Cloth?
And he killed every last one of 'em!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
Mister Powell!
Amen.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Yes, I reckon that's it.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Dead.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
Yonder.
You could save him, little bird.
Yes?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
No.
Because John said I mustn't.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Our honeymoon.
She turned me out of the bed.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Yes.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
How'do.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
My flesh and blood!
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Hi.
Who?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
You don't know he did it.
You know he's dead though, right?
Deal.
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after. See you.
Great
Nancy?
Okay.
S'curity.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
Nobody's gonna kill you.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
He's nuts about you.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
No more fights.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Naturally, Comrade.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Evening gown?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Possibly.
That's right.
I can tell you exactly.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Monsieur.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
That's right.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Good evening, Monsieur.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Certainly.
Thank you, Louis.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
What is it, my boy?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
While you eat, you look at the view.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Look for yourselves.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Monsieur.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Even the swallows are back.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
But you had!
I think so too.
No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I'll try.
That's a strange angle.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Wounded? How?
No, that was restful. Again.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
I don't like your following me.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
No.
Yes.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Anything, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, I love you.
My darling.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
No speech?
No! No!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
They belong to the people.
Please.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Oh, yes.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Am I interrupting?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I told you to go, madame.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask why?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
This will do. 
Raw carrots and beets.
How do you do, my friend.
My jewels?!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Where the hell is he?
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
How so?
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
How do you see this?
That's right ...
Sir?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
"Security" is not strong enough.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
How is this national security?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
You never told him?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Sir ... six bodies.
Why me?
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
My friends call me "Mister President."
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Yes ...
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Agreed.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Why?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... but it was all we had.
Mr. Nixon.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
POWs.  And their families.
Sir?
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
Who else'd be in your truck.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
When did he die?
I'm... discouraged.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
You ain't heard from him?
Some pretty bad people.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
No. Probably I don't.
I'm hidin' behind you.
I don't know. He ought to...
Yes sir.
Okay.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Just keep it up.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Is Llewelyn there?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
No me mate.
You from around here?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Yeah. I know where you're going.
You know she won't be there.
I see.
See about closing.
Sir?
Sir?
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
No.
Somethin' like that.
The kind with the most poles.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
That's twenty-six dollars.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yes?
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
What else then?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I been immobile.
I'm a welder.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
What did I say?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
I don't know. American citizens.
I don't know.
Yes sir.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
No, I didn't have to.
Little place called "Williams," why?
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Oh. How come?
...I... I know what you are.
Umm, I don't think that...
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
...what're you saying?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
What?
Yeah, me too.
I gotta go make dinner.
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No, Del.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Ad lib?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I ran back in to get the phone.
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Make sure it's elevated...
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Did you love it?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Man, that is love.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
How many men have I talked to?
What? Where was he?!
...okay.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Where are you going?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
No, that should be more than --
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Fine. You got five...
No...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
My socks?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Worse... you're in Texas.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
It just didn't fit her profile...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do you mean?
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! Let me try this!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Better.
Would you say she was ambitious?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
- and share one of your graves.
Do not seek the treasure!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Problem a p'seption.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
- in the gods - Huh?
Not your...
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
He ain't our daddy!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
I been calling for four months.
Great.
What for?
Nobody. It just came to me.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Yeah, I know.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Yes, sir!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Aw screw it...
No, sir.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yes, sir!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
He was. He died.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Be a friend. Leave.
I've never had a girl.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I know that.
So?
I bet you do!
Yeah. All week long.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Yeah.
A little.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
But she expects you to marry her?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
God.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
I have the gun.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Not that one.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Pure idiot.
Hey.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Huh?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
It's okay, Raoul.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
What?
Why?
Well, I know that now.
That room!
What am I, a five year old?
"Titanic."
I'm sorry.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Yeah.
What's with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
I don't know. Look around man.
No man. PE -- "political education."
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
You mean...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Yeah.
So what's the deal?
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Right on Brother Judge...
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
No.
You call that a compliment?
Thank you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Do you?
Very well, then.
With a lace table cloth?
My pleasure, sir.
Apology accepted.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Very well, proceed, sir.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Prisoner exchange.
Probably.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry.
Long time.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Thank you.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Worse.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Bite?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yayyy!
To remember.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
I know.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Yes.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
I guess so...but...
Don't worry about that.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Remember.
It's beautiful!
And Church will be fine.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
The trees are taller.
More to drink!
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Indeed.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
How?  The key's run off.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Barbossa.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
I'll lead them away.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes.
He's not telling the truth.
Where did he come from?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Until he's done.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
No, thank you.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Thank you, sir.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Who isn't?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
I guess I should be flattered.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
You're insane.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
The waste.
What happens?
No, why?
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
No problem.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
The head shrinker at the prison.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
The question is, are you?
And you have him?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Dexter.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
What are you talking about?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Stewart!
That's ridiculous.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Why—
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Well, I should say!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I'm afraid.
Yeah - go on.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
With me you can always do business.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
No!
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Must be my wife.
Right!
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Right.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Yeah?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
She did—?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Double strength!
I have. Double-strength!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
I understand, sir.
Now the lady said you may go—
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
What?
We're in Pleasantville?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Sure.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Thanks ... I love you.
Bud brought it to me.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I don't want it to go away.
Where are you gonna go?
Um ... It's ...
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
What's the matter?
She won't go out with me?
Okay, that's IT!!!
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Yes I do.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
You're not allowed to lie.
Why am I out of order?
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
What?
Get lost!
As a matter of fact he does.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What were you doing in a library?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
He won't notice anyway.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Nothing.
That's great.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
I told you. I'm like positive.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
What?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Ooomph?
What the hell's going on!
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh--well ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Why?
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
... Yeah.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Why?
No, that's not it.
Just a little--You know.
What happened?
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
No, no, no.
And what was this?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
Ok. Thank you.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Hello everyone.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm sorry.
It's fine, but --
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
It's not mine.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
I....please don't do this.
...yeah.....
Can I ask you a question?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yeah.
Really? Please?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
I know I did. But I don't.
This is not cool.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
Thank you.
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
So that was your pudding?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
What?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.
...I don't know what you mean....
Thank you.
yeah.
Yeah......yeah.....
For what?
You can't do that.
Ok, bye, bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I know.
Sorry.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
....I have seven.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Where you goin?
What?
You have an ATM?
You have another house somewhere or something?
Alright, alright.
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
You can't be late.
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
You ready?
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Once or twice.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
You among them?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You always do.
Valcour. His chair.
An innocent child is dead.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
It's a formality; truly.
He's sworn to obedience.
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Poorly.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
No. But tell him I would.
I pray you: be succinct.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Of course.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Forgive me, I beg you --
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Not you too
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
I can't
But I am That's the killer, honey.
So I've been told.
Randolph!
There's no call for that language-
Don't
How much?
I am not that woman.
I will not defend my life to you--
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir? 
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
No -- no -- I mean--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
So speaks the court jester.
Don't do this
Don't do this
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Uh huh.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
It's too late. The movie's made
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Get out
Again.
Again
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Jesus
They've all seen a rough cut
The ad..
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I don't want to sit
Happy birthday.
I'm Christ
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
I'm Ok.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Whatsa matter with you?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I just wanted to say hello.
It feels real good.
Come over here.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
I never noticed his face.
What did I do?
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I am answering...
With Salvy, eh?
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Ever get an answer?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
That depends on who "they" were.
I told you that --
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
It's me.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Who are you?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
How?
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
You called the police?
What?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's probably one in the basement.
How much do you think you'll need?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Uh-huh.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
To get on home.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
What about it?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
But you're not?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Phone number?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
What?
Somebody find him a knife.
Okay.
I think I should go home.
You make any sandwiches?
Yeah!
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Well--
Will you wait a minute?
I don't want to learn that!
Sure.  Sure.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
That's right!
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Do you hear from him, son?
Well maybe she better start.
Plato.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
What's the charge?
Hi there.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
Who's that!
Judy.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I'm here.
I've got a gun.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
I need it.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Mom--I'm not--
What's that got to do with it?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
I don't know why--!
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
You going there?
A what?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I felt like it.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
You disappointed?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
We have to go back!
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
My mother?
Gabriel -- !
What are you doing here?!
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
No, baby. He wants me.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Radio said negative five.
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Yes it was all you --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
I'll see what I can do.
NICK!
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, no --
Canada.
They're truck drivers.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Nick, what are you talking about?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You shouldn't have.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
The hell I can't.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Samantha.
Bam Bam.
A station wagon in Canada.
And I worked there. For a year.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
I'm gonna need some money.
...never... tried...
What's the code?
Six men means six guns.
I'm no threat without a gun.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
How'd you know my name...
Take 'em.
I don't know... what you're...
GO!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
What?
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Five years. Since it opened.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Not with you.
Alamo...
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
I... sorry, Mister...
They changed the layout.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Where was she from, Compton?
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
It's a change.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Dead as Dillinger.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
That's your proof?
Nope.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You didn't ask.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
I'm okay.
Joe.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
It's not good...
I can' take you to a hospital.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Uh-uh, just cops.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
What do you think?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I think he's just passed out.
If we don't, he'll die.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
This is what he was doin'.
There's a slight difference.
Nobody. The light was bad.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
And one of 'em is sick.
As far as -- Sonora?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
He's learning his letters.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
It's going to Sonora.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
A man I used to know.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Three men on matched roans?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
What's there to be fair about?
What's there to be fair about?
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Well, say it.
There aren't any women here.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Stop it --
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Put on another one.
I sure would.
Good night, Steve.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
And you've got me all figured out?
You were supposed to be reading words.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Alex, what are you doing?
Never happened!
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
No. I never date outside my race.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Hugh Kane.
Shit!
Can you feel that?
I know, but I've been thinking --
Then what are we going to do?
What, you think I did this to myself?
But he'll kill her!
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Not in a thousand years.
Made you say it!
Yes!!!!
My child, you're alive!
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Who?
Saw who?!
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
That's why we came here, remember?
Hi.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Yours, or the turkeys?
My help?
My holy water.
No, I'm fine.
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
But, Chip...
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
That's right.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
I beg your pardon?
COCKSUCKER! 
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I do, please.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Right here!
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Yes you are.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You can?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Where?
You think my sister is there?
Can we go there now?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
No.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
Thank you.
What sort of danger?
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
She could use a hundred dollars.
She can only use cash.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
Nothing.
Weren't you afraid?
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
That you love Mary.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm afraid.
And then?
Good-bye.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Devil worshippers!
I can imagine.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
She was my patient.
Uh—huh.
Perhaps
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
What did he say?
Why
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Yes?
False alarm.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
No. Why?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Nine years.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Sister older or younger?
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Basically, yes.
Can we look at one?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Don't you want to make one?
What do you have to do to get ready?
I have money.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Possibly.
I don't care.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
He does.
What do you mean?
Radon leakage?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I guess.
Yes.
Yes.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
And... do whatever it is you do.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
You don't know that for sure.
I can't believe you did that!!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Well. I can't stay.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
Nope.
Nope.
Talking.
I just want to ask you questions.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
Hi.
No? Not even one more?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Why?
Could be risky.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
I want to see you.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
No.  You said three-fifty?
How about for five hundred?
You were prying before?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
So is my wife, asshole!!
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He'll be really mad.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Sure.
Yes.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK. But late.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Just breathe normally.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Gonna cut me open?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
OK. I'll think about it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
Fools!
What's cookin', Bert?
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
He needs help.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
...closed?
He was a President.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
What show?
Why?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
No...couldn't I do this later?
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
No.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Good. That's good.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Huh.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Me too.
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
I'm working on it.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Whoa.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Pour us a couple.
You know her?
How do you know?
So what's the plan today?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Bathroom.
We were supposed to play golf.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What? Of course I like Christine.
Thanks, Jack.
You're an asshole.
Shut up.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What exactly are we going to do?
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Thanks.
Huh. Let me think.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
Uh-huh.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Hrnrnrn?
You said it looked like a car accident.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Whatever. Sorry.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Sure.
The Windmill.
See you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
A paper?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Sure.
What about me?
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
About four weeks.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
No dad!
It tastes funny.
My ballet recital.
Who said I was going to die?
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What time is it?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
Me too.
Have they said anything about our area?
I have some upstairs.
Oh.
What's two?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
What did you say?
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
No money, eh?
It was my fault.
Sure.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Is he alive?
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
That's why I'm here.
Yeah... that must have been it.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Ten A.M.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
I expect.
He is that.
I understand.
You haven't got any money.
I'll be around.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
And a pretty lady.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
The other guy drew first.
Howdy.
Really?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
It's none of your business.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
You don't know?
Where's Emmett now?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
I am telling the truth.
Okay -- for you.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Almost right.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Even the fall from the plane.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Viktor, you should have said something.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Thank you.
When is she coming over?
Not quite.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Who are you really?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
How about the nudity?
Body double.
Why not?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I know what you mean.
Simone!
-- Please, get away from me.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good for you, Hank.
I've seen them all before.
What's that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Hello, sweetheart.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I do okay.  How about you?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
No, that was me.
This is the story.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
It's a yacht.
Abduction?
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Er,... good.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
My God, you've got one?
Long live the First Amendment.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Taller, Viktor.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes, I'd like that.
Good.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
I didn't leave you.
Dr. Crowe.
You use needles?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
No.
You do?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
What?
What?
They used to hang people here.
Like what?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Chuck E. who?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
What's a "little while?"
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Tramp.
Someone actually... employs you?
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Book of Jeremiah.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I don't think so.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
What's wrong?
He started it.
Amen.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Never.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Starla, it ain't --
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
You took Bill.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Brought you munchies.
What can I do you for?
All the rib eyes?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You know how rumors start.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Okay.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Yeah?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Weight Station.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That man is your father?!?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
See.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Running blocker.
Go.
Yeah, guy?
I'll believe it when I see it.
We'll be waiting. Over.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Mortal.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
I thought Heller was a double op?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- will be handled back in --
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
I'm here.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Yeah, I can front this.
A million flat.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
What's the time frame?
I can trust Rheya.
You're not Gibarian...
Didn't you talk to Snow?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
How quickly?
Why, who did you see?
That depends.
And professionally?
What is it?
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll be right back.
Stop it.
Rheya.  Not here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you mean?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
How old were you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You don't love me.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Do you?
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
I'm disgusting.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
You should have told me.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
Why do you say that?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
There's a phone in the car.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
I can't open it.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire, will you calm down?
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
Oh God, that's great!
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
Yeah...
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Claire...
Your what...?
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I might stop you.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
She bought it.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I'm sorry.
I watched TV.
What about Tommy?
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Lay back, Mack.
Yeah, I think so.
No. No, that's okay.
I know.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
They'll never take me alive.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Right.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
But you like that in a man?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I'm sure you kept warm.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
I don't care.  Cretin.
I will finish what I've begun…
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
What?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Bonkers.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Is you all good Nazis?
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Static!
That'll do.
Yeah. Security.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
We're looking at it.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Me? What if she don't want me?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
She'll never forgive me!
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Let me alone.
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Good.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Says who?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
You can tell Father Murray to --
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What about the radio?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Russian women prisoners?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Just don't drool on it.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
He is.
Thanks for pointing that out.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Twelve years, sir.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
I believe so.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
You get what?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
On screen.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Yes, where would you go?
It's our pleasure.
Oh, of course.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
You could say that.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
What's normal?
What do you want?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
There are no other ships in the system.
Aye, sir.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
What did you see, Chekov?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
What is it?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
I'll handle that later.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
None that I can detect, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Yes, my lord!
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
How can you think of food at a time like this?
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
You know what she'll say...
Ssssh!
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
What?
How soon --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Visual --
I shall avenge you --
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
KHAN!
Listen to me -- you men and women --
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Admiral --
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Yes, SIR.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
How far?
Yes.
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Be careful, Jim...
Spock...!
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
They just don't want us going in there.
Aye, sir.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir --
Engage warp engines --
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
I exaggerated.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Where must you go?
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
What do you think, Spock?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
We're just -- observing.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Implicitly.
... You're very perceptive.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You need me.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Explain.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
How will playing cards help?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Weapons systems?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Uhura!... Where!
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Millions?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
They are my friends.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
This way!
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
No one's ever asked me that before.
And our people?
Are they in any danger?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Is it safe to move her?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
The Ba'ku.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Fail-safe?
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
If it works you mean.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
We're through running from these bastards.
Commander Riker...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
No, sir...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
What are they interested in...?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
All ship functions are off-line.
Absolutely.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Vulcan?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
I am the Borg.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
How serious is the damage?
There should be some kind of manual release...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Active.
Ready.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I can try.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
I have to...
No. It's a lot further than that.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Go to manual.
Life signs?
Yes, sir.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Just a little queasy...
Understood!
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
What kind of message?
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
We've been set up all along.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Stand...?
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
I beg your pardon?
I checked the data banks, yes.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
ALL uniforms?
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
He's got it.
Anything else you want to tell me?
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Right -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
When does this conference start?
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
So, that's it..
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Such things have happened before, sir.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
We've been ordered to -
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What's left of it.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
I am in a room with lights.
Because you are dangerous.
No. Can I move now?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
That was another time.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
On my way.
Aye, sir... This way.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Fire!
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Negative.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .

The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Sir?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
On screen.

There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Not with the Romulans.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
She's a predator.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I've never met a human woman.
Yes.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
In time.
Why am I here?
You're not Reman.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Why are you here?
And what of the Enterprise?
Long ago.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
He is what his life has made him!
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !

We should have. Let me see.
Eh... yes.
No.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Shermin...
Marc Shermin.
What.
Good.
That way.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Yes.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
Gas good?
You'll see.
I know.
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
No.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
It was yellow.
You better.
Yes.
Why?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Yes.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I understand.
No. Get in.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I must meet my ship.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
Yes, they are.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Call the police!!
My grandmother's rich.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
Twenty-eight years.
Yes.
It was a man though... right?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Leave him alone, Tran.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
We should talk alone.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Yeah.  No, not really.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Why me?
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Jesus!
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Strickland.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
You'll see.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
It's not your fault.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Uh unh.
Aw, Mom!
Take the tape to the cops.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
You're thinking...?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Winona.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Yes.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
At the field office.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
What I do requires confidentiality.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Huh?, sir.
I was visiting an old college friend.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
They're all criminals?
You got a point there.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
You did.
Oh.
What's that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
What's up?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
And you're working with him?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Yes.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Zero killed them all?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You knew it was me all along?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I don't know about that.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shut up.
Hi.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Anything.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Yeah. And an actor.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
Hi, Mike?
I can call back...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I thought you met someone else.
...the Michelin commercial...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Kinda.
I do. Good for you, man.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Go for it, man.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
So, what? Eleven?
Not well.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
What?
Did she, or did she not smile?
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
I know, but...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Let's go.
What an asshole.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
What?!?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
It starts at eight...
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
That doesn't matter.
...How novel.
No.
No.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're money...
...just be smart about it.
Six.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'm not hungry yet.
Yeah.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
We gotta move...
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
How?
Yes.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Yes.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
They're waiting to see my father.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Al Capone!
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
How do you do.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I love you.
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Goodbye.
Oh Michael.
I can help you out...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
I do renounce them.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Did you speak to my father?
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No!
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
That's good.
Ripley's plans.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
What are you doing?
Dickie?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
I think it might hurt her to know.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
I'm sure we've met.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I hope she never knows.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
To the manner born.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
What?
I can explain.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
How did you know that?
I know.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
A ragione. A ragione. 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Thanks.
I can't later.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
No key, huh?
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
It's okay.
I give up.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Peter, I... I...
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
November, I thought.
31 people.
You have, yes.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Ouch!
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
You carry a piece? You need one?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
A girl needs protection.
That's what you think.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Do I look like a narc?
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Damn straight.
Yes.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Shit.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
What's going on?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
It happens.
Thanks.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
Partners.
Hi.
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh...
Oh.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
I don't smoke?
Oh.
Guess I must've learned.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
A statement?
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
Shhhhhh.
What's that?
Thanks.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
A super market.  Huh.
When did I leave?
Nine and-a-half years...
Ah.
Who... are they?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
Oh, no, I...
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Pete...
No, sir.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Can we get him to the hospital?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
So, it is a blacklist.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No thanks.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
When was that?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Yeah... me too.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Oh.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Yes.  Very.
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Yes, I did.
If you have some, I'd...
What do you mean?
Different?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Look.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I don't know, honey.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Morning.
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Shall I call the doctor?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
I'm simply quoting the law.
I know, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I don't know.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Shhh. Shhh.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like me to go for her?
Did you close the door?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
That's all right.
Well, I...
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Lovebirds.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
The sign says strawberry finches.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
What for?
How do you know Annie?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
Yes.
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
Helping travelers.
What'll it say?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I'll get it.
It's an uprising.
Growing a beard...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Maybe.
No... wait.  Hold me.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes.
I have no idea.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
No one called it a war!
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
I'm not sure, but...
With smoke.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Not if they're starting a war.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Good.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
I know --
Yes.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Nearly a year.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
No great lady will ever take my place?
I'll get him.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
The scar.
He didn't kill her.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I don't know. I found him lying there.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Not tonight. Honest.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Would you care to be more specific?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
I leave that in your hands.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Professor Barnhardt.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Why not, Bobby?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
Just Klaatu.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Thank you... Have you any news?
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Is it real?
Is that what you're thinking about?
Jittery is the word.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight, my dear.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Who?
I -- I thought you were--
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
I'd give you a very good price.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
No -- I'm afraid not.
You don't.
This one could save your life.
You better get some fresh air.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
You gotta drive!
That's just the way we like it.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Maximum body-count.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What?...
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Hit the lights again.
Chill out Edgar.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Closet monster!?
You have a T.V.?
Did we have a date tonight?
This is Michael.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Mom... please.
What's that smell?
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Lucy.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Star.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
So do I!
What would that make Mom?
Nanook...
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Huh?...
Just listen.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Maybe.
So what's our problem?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
I don't know who to trust.
We'll see...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Hell no.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Cut him loose?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
That's good enough.
We got morphine, don't we.
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
What for?
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Come on, Copper.
Thank you.
A couple of hours.
That far?
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Damn if I won't.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
He's dead.
Can you think of any other tests?
Just keep looking.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Anyplace but here.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
MacReady...?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
The journey is part of my work.
Excuse me?
What?
It frightens you.
It was meant to.
Oh, shut up.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes... Thank you.
End...?
I don't understand.
As slaves.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
I know.
Because...
I -- what are you?!
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Got here as soon as I could.
I need... to talk to you.
Let them.
I have something for you...
Tonight's the night?
How romantic...
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
For God's Sake, David --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
I live with it every minute of every day.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Yes...
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Thank you.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
You're not from beyond the valley.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Why not?
You can see so many here.
I can see Kalen's point.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
How do you decide?
It must have been safe.
Orion's belt...
Go back to your own time?
Mara...?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
May I get you some --
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
New Yorkers.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
They've gone to a better place.
Dean Fulton...
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're inside --
Then don't.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
And what does that mean?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I never touched your father! I swear!
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What?
Yes.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I don't know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
No, he didn't.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Good. How's your mom?
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I could try to...make it stop.
So it's helping?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
How...how do you know?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
What are you talking about?
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Sure.
[Beat] Thanks.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You want to come on in?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
It's him.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
What for?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I'm a robber.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
What the fuck is going on?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Yes.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
How come he let you go?
Isn't this fun?
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
So this is all my fault, is it.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
What did Darryl say?
I won't wait up.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Yes!  I believe I am!
Yeah.
What.
I... I...
You're right.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I believe you.
Are you alright?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
It's grand!
All this for us?
Hi there!  You alright?
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Never?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Yeah, right.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
I don't know what to say.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
I'm usually too tired to be.
Huh.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Out getting coffee.
'That right?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Am I?
You found my car?!
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
No thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
Thanks.
It's right there on your golf bag.
I beg your pardon?
That sounds like fun.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
What?
Huh... that's strange.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Uh-huh.
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You can't be serious.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Really?  Very, very?
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Surprised?
Your turn?
What?
Harvard?
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
What's that supposed to mean?
No I'm not.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
He's no Steve Young.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Where would I have seen your work?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Huh?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh... are you... ?
No short game.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
I think a little of both.
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Tomorrow...
Where the hell are you?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We've got bigger problems right now.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
Yeah.
Says what, Kenny?
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
An invasion...
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
What about you? Where are you going?
Good.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
That may be what they want us to think.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
You're my hero, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
James Looks Twice?
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Sioux Indian, right?
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
It ain't Geronimo.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Jesus...
Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
When did we get that?
Thanks, Cooch.
She's that subtle?
Let the press through.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He knows me?
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
A what?
What you call myths, we call our history.
Likewise.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
What do you mean?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
You didn't have another vision...
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
It's not that.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
You know. The finger.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Make what?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
It's just as I thought.
And now?
Why?
In that order?
What?
Not to me.
What?
I like to play "reality".
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
I hope you find him.
Well what?
Right on the flight line?
Yes sir.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Not anymore.
Okay, okay.
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
But I have to!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
On what?
So's my Johnson.
Who's your pilot?
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
What?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
Don't.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
We did it.
No. You can be mine!
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Yes sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
No bother.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
The Last Resort.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Fuck you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Eight years.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
You went to Rekall, remember?
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Up to the right.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got Quaid.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
I don't know.
But I'm always home by morning.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Oh God, Doug.
I'm not your wife.
I'm honored.
Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
How real does it seem?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
I love you.
Not any more.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Jump!
I gave you?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
My cannon.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Could we make it to the mountains?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Has a lot of rain.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
That's the plan.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Val!  Val!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
You got <u>that</u> right!
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
We got a plan!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
It does.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
Please... I need to sleep...
True.
Let go of my hair.
-- With objection!
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Shut your sewer mouth!
What about entrapment?
Can't I take a simple piss without --
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
No. No...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
I've seen this picture before.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
EXACTLY!
Want to tell me what went down here?
This and that.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
That's right.
Badgering.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
That's right.
-- Roger --
That's right.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
A woman.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
You killed Mike.
What was?
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where's Hap?
How come Jack let's you work here?
What happened to her?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
How do you figure?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
Cole said she was 17.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
I think that's a good idea.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Maybe.
If I can smoke it.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No.
WE got it back, that's all.
I haven't got it yet.
Who would do that?
What does Bob say?
I'm not.
What? She asked about my father?
Let's go all the way.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Not now.
Everything, but everything.
You mean the ones you pity.
See what?
Boating?
Hiking?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Fish eyes?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom, take it easy.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
I'm fine.
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
Yes.
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
I know of him.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
Yes.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Why is that?
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
'Code Blue'...
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
...and you're going to do that?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Yes.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
The TV didn't work.
And what are you? A cop?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
You're talking like a drunk.
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
From the magazine?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...fifty thousand dollars?
Yes.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
What?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Oh shit, what's today?
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
I don't want a mistrial.
In New York?
Yes.
Should I?
We'd be in all the papers!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It was...  ...one of them!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
They'll probably move at dawn.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Chase...
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
No...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Finish, please!
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
They were safe and could sleep.
The mean old man with the claws.
Not sleepy.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Home, that's right.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah...how'd you know?
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
He knows.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Yes sir.
Okay.
Gieg, Chuck.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
What?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
I know.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
What?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Because it looks good.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
Shut up, Phil.
I guess.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I know enough.
We all have problems.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Who?
Yes sir.
Face what?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sir...?
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
No.
No.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
He's a big boy.
I should be eating with the crew.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
That's enough.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
I figured it out.
It seems we're short on singers.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I'm not staying out here.
Joy, rapture...
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
He climbed when he was ready.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
This be it?
How old are you?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Fuck me.
Sorry to hear it.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Have now.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Used to.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
That bastard Pucinski...
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You ain't actin', mama.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
No, he picked me up.
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
She got me an abortion...
What's that, peanut?
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I'm goin'.
Yeah.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Under a hundred.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
You think she's gonna make it?
Fan works.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Lead the way.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
SAILOR!!!!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Shoot him.
Santos... I can't...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
So?
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Your wife.
She's still a transvestite.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Shut up and drink.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Because... because...
Just go around him.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Where would we go?
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Only in your bones?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Ye-es?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
Excuse me?
You must be mistaken.
You did.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
And your wife left you.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Sounds like a good one.
It's colder in there.
Heaven?
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Yea, James.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Miss Sloviak's.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Just checking.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
She's left before...
Simple.
Hm.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Sick.
Her husband.
I was thinking of you.
A jockey? You mean, like --
I doubt it, darling.
You want to keep him happy.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Something wrong with that?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
Isn't it?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
I mean... feelings.
In that birch tree is a nest.
The mother sure has her hands full.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's a bright sound.
It's my bird book.
Why don't you just tell me?
Yeah.
Fairy tales?
What?
No.
I could take you downtown.
'Fraid not.
You are in.
What?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
The job's okay.
What?
Ev-i-dence.
Reflect.
Honest? No.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
We have a lot of work to do.
I'm afraid not.
I don't.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I said I was sorry.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I see my sister.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
This is garbage!
Are you okay?
I'll buy a plant.
Sorry.
Why do you want to know?
Not tonight.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
You think I have a problem?
It's been a while since...
Maybe later.
What?
Hey, I'm not --
I know.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
You must hate your brothers.
You never asked them about it?
Not ever?
What?
Live together.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Who doesn't?
Fine.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
You're such an asshole.
Do what?
Not when they fly.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
No way that could just be seawater.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Wasn't up to me.
Your rig?
I'm switching off now.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Yeah.  So sue me.
You noticed.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Who then?
Why bring it here?
Yuh?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You watch yourself.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
How many are there?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
How deep?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
She'll wait.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
You already know what they are.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why haven't they left each other?
And how do you explain that?
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But then when will we see each other?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
And what about you?
Are you joking?
And why did you drop them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Okay. In a few minutes.
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
You say that just to flatter me.
But then why did you bother changing?
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
There too...
We'll try again.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
I don't see why I should mind.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
You know, I don't love anybody.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
You're kidding!
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
He talked to you Himself?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
Oh my dear child.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes, of God.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
No.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
In the middle of all the pain?
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Not at the moment, no.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Where did you go?
No, but I can never tell her that.
No...
Yes.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Because I wasn't worthy.
No.
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What do you do?
Yes.
What did she mean?
Agnes who did you see?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
What about Roger? He's free.
When?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
How do you survive?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Uh huh.
Who told you this?
Unfiltered.
No-one.
Yes.
Obviously there was.
That possibility never occurred to you?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Answers.
Earthquakes?
Was the child full term?
What sheets?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I knew that after the fact.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who is he?
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Then she's a liar.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah?
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Read 'em!
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Have I said something amiss?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He's sulking again.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Follow your impulse.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
What's that mean?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Is she?
You can learn from books.
Parading?
Yeah ... that's right.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
Have they?
Nothing good.
Is there a fire, then?
Hello.
I'll look after meself.
Here, Pauly.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Hiding.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Like what?
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Ah, go on, you swine.
Well you're not going.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Well ...
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Sorry.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
That's too easy for Lennon.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Get knotted!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Or something will be able to see us.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
I'll see what I can do.
Is it solid?
Then take her down.
Take a look.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
What?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
How's Broussard?
Can you do anything for him?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
How do we locate the creature?
Sounds like a rough one.
At least it can't get up here now.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Oh... God...
We can use the flamethrower.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
Can you see anything?
What is it?
Let's let the machine work on him.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
We're going into the freezers now.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
Yeah?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
What killed it?
Oh well... you know me.
Is that its mouth?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Up one kilometer, Jay.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Go ahead, Jay.
Let's be democratic.
What's that supposed to mean?
So the next step should be --
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Can we get to him?
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Who gets the privilege?
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Yeah...
Wait a minute.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
We're what!?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Uh-huh.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
And before that?
Want some?
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
No!
What time's sundown?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Paved with what, then?
Why'd call me a killer?
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
A dull cliche.
What of it?
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
You're being childish.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
We have that in common.
Eve! My understudy...
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
I'll try.
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
I get a party, don't I?
I love you...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don't mix your metaphors.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Glory Hallelujah.
What would you like? Texas?
You know what I'm going to be?
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
It's only one picture deal.
Of course not.
Is that what you want me to be?
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Oh, brother.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Well?
No.
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
How did you get in here?
What for?
Probably not.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
He's the best.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
- an understudy's performance.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Not at all...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I had no idea you knew each other.
Really, Eve? Why?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
You've what?
Roughly ten minutes.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
I just can't believe it.
Check.
In a minute...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve?
That was a pity...
With gestures, of course.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Such as?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
You'd have been proud of her.
That's beside the point.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I have no intention of having an accident!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
You're not a kid anymore.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
Nixon.
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--Colson.
How high up, which Republicans?
--Haldeman I know, who else?
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Whatever.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--Deep Throat?--
--there's nothing new in it--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
Which people?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
So?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
Government. Recently retired.
I think so.
Nobody ever had too much.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
I did all right on McCord.
You can't believe that.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
When so ordered.
Of course--everything they asked--
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
I'm not good in math.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
I know, it sucks!
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
You mean...and orgasm?
But that one time --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
I don't get it, that really works?
You can crash at Stifler's?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Pontificated.
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
I'm not going.
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Okay!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Okay.
For me?
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You think so?
I think "shithead" really says it.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Yeah, right here.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Andy!
Serafine...?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Really.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
And you call me a moron...
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Yes sir.
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You must have.
Yes, your highness.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Why?
Trying... to... breathe...
It's not you - it's the dress!
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I'll never let go!
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
How do you know?
It worked in Odessa...
Watch me.
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Run, Anya -  go...
No. Empress, you --
Young	man, I...
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Come on.
What?
Alvy Singer over here!
M'mm.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
It's okay.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, stop listening to him.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Wisconsin.
Well, where is it? I-
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
No, so help me.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
It's terrific.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
M'hm.
Yeah.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Let's just do it, all right?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Following is different. I was spying.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Yeah.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
W-w-whatta you mean?
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Thing?
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
I'm late.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
You have a raccoon?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
Key word here is "indulgent."
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
It's a narrow view.
...as opposed to a print...
Whatta you mean?
May I see your license, please?
Right, Max. California, Max.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
We can show her the schoolyard.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
You think so? Do you really?
...of possibly working together.
It was a wonderful set.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Oh yes.
Very well.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
You're fucking desperate.
Absolutely not.
Why last?
And how's the diva doing?
What?
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Really.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
When does he graduate high school?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Lucy overdosed.
Excuse me?
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
There's still time to undo this.
Ryan's novel.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Truce?
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
He'll find his way back.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
It's a novel.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I have no idea who you are.
Everybody hates the messenger.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't be silly.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
I'm sorry.
How long have you been married?
You must have been a baby.
Sorry?
Clair is a hovering mother.
Let's just go home, okay?
Not at all.
Oh?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
You don't know she's a bitch.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Yes.  Fine.
No.  Not something new.
Thanks.
That's not an answer, is it?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Ah.
Would you like to meet my husband?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
And the food sucks, I know.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well...  I declared war!
Wanna dance?
<u>What</u>?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
I'm Princess Bala.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You held onto this all that time?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Mom!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Barbatus?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
I...I have no idea, sir.
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
Something the matter?
Oh!
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Good night.
Would you like to?
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
I think so.
The mirror -- it's broken.
You don't want me here --
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
I mean -- her apartment.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
A bad insurance risk?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
I just want some fresh air.
For me?
I don't want to talk to him.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You did?
No, I don't.
That's terrible.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
What?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm fine all over.
Seven --  -- queen.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Swap them? For what?
Oh, you don't have to worry --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
What does he mean, accident?
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I have a vague idea.
Yeah.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Let me get my bag.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Sure, Doc.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
No.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Who?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
No.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
You know I liked it better long.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Are you sure that's what you want?
You know I do.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Yeah, we better.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Don't you ever stop talking?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Dreadful.
We need all our fuel.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Esprit de corps --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Who are you ?
I don't know.
Looks that way.
God knows.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Let's go.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Too far inland.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
But why ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Music?
Yes, I know.
I'm Kurtz.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like it...
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yes, I know...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
What?
Nah.
His name is...
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Needs patching.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Wait 'til I'm across!
134  CONTINUED:  
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
I just want this over with.
157  CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Keep back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
-- Corbett's a killer.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
That's my line.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'm staying.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
I'm right behind you.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
No, I better stay at my post.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Sure.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I love you.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
My son is sick, okay?
How do you know about my mother?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Two days.
You take off when you have to.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Nonsense!
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
No.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
This one has a special meaning.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
I had to see you...
Okay.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Okay by me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
What's he look like?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Okay, then.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
You consider your life easy.
Another place where?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
I ain't scared of you.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Yes.
Just Electra?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
How did you get into the business?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
Why not?
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
Did it ever bother you?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
Where is it?
Thinking.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Okay.
Fine.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
That means you won't have a gun.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
For Nicholai?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
No.
I didn't notice them.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
What?
Okay.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Sometimes.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
A dime.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Like you?
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
What's that? Free!
An alternative literary venue!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
When your ready Son!
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Did you see anything in the files?
Good, what's his number?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
So am I.
Yes.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Sure. Excellent.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Really?
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Ooh, well excuse me.
You used to read.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Whatever!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Fernet and tonic.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Thanks.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
But I love you!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yo, dobree!
Good, great....Dobchay!
Ah, so what?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Am I invited?
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
I had it coming from someone.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Alright!
A kind of freedom.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Later.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
And I have no idea why.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
That's over. Way over.
No. I won't be long.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
He wants to talk to you.
I need to whizz.
York Ave.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
What kind of a man are you, son?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Good thing.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
Healthy as can be.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
And why would that scare me?
When I have something to say.
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Me.
Anything you want.
That I want you to take me home.
I'm not going back to school.
Lower. Same page.
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Yes.
Up to?
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
That won't be possible.
Like what, sir?
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
How -- how long does she have?
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
She did. It was you.
I want to come back.
For pay?
I'd work backstage or something?
I didn't say you did.
What do you want, Biff?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Coming, Eileen...
Well... yeah...
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Five cents, please.
Home, school, here... 
Shhhhhhhh!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
AM or PM?
...To be traveled through
Precisely! 
So what? We'd be rich!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
That's just great!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Sure,.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
He said not to tell.
Okay.
Not bad.
They come with the house.
No, he showed me one.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
Yeah. I can imagine.
What for?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
There you go.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't care.
But it would hurt.
How bad off is he?
You said that once already... Too late now.
He was nervous.
Put that down. It's dirty.
How's he doing?
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
No.
Yes.
Wanta sue me?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
They're stealing my chopper!
Vanished. Thin air.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Any time.
She was killed, Penny.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
...Who is this?
I...
What else?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
No, what did it say?
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Well, you just... sound a little–
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
And I could tell you some stories –
Well, I can tell you some stories –
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
What do you mean?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Lou.
...Both maybe?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Yes sir, they –
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Excuse me?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
What –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What do you do, Fink?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Anyway.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
How's about it, Bart?
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
Did you find out about her parents?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Thank you.
Nilsen.
Sometimes I really hate you.
What did she tell me, Beth?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
Yes.
I have nothing to hide.
No.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
No.  Come in.
There's a name from the past.
No.
Please.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
To see if he can get away with it.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I'll risk it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you like her to watch?
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I don't know.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Cocaine.
Routine.
Nilsen?
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I know what that's like.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
We bring her in for questioning.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.
The whole thing – painting.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
That's good. At least they're interested.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Aren't they?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Willie Mays.
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
Oh – you mean black people!
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Good. What do you have?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Can I walk you home?
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
What who's saying?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It's Monday morning.
You want some?
Think so?
What's that about?
George?
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yeah.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I will relay the message.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
You'll never guess.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
I'm -- sorry, I --
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Maybe you're right.
Have we?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm tempted.
Yeah?  Me too...
Yes and no...
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
I recognized the accent.
I hate being lectured.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Surf's up.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
What?
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I knew you could handle it.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Dr. Meridian...
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Tonight's a good night.
Just checking, young sir.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Just ones this beautiful.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Well, I met someone...
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
And now....
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What?
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
What I do isn't about revenge.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Bruce, you can't.
What the hell is going on here?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
You sunk my battleship.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
... Where are you taking me?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Because I want someone I can trust.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
What?  I improved her a little...
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Oh, Bruce...
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Allie, he's not.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Your face smells like a foot.
Ahm.....
oh dear.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Isn't it?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Er ... pray tell me why?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ahm....
Certainly is.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Of course he is.
What?
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Cool, huh huh.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Heh heh, thanks.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Deep and hard.
That's better. Yes?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Uh, Butt-Head.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
How's your arm?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This is going to take some time.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Not really...  what's this?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
Where are your skulls and bones?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
He might have hurt somebody.
3:30 I guess.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Yeah.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Gooood!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Their wedding clothes.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
But not for long...
I see.
Thank you.
No, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I have no idea...
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Fine. He's very nice.
... Mentor...?
Hello, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Thank you, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, I understand.
I certainly do.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Oh, I see.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Of men and women.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
... Good evening, Louise.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
I see...
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Try again.
Try again.
I said - try again.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No problem, Chief.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Right, Chief.
Right, Chief.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Who am I thinking of?
Tell your friends.
I... puppeteer.
Hmmm.
Hi.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'm scared.
We'll talk about it in the car.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You've always loved the animals.
Fuck Maxine.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I said "yes."
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
You married?
The usual, Barry.
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
It better be.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hello. Wendy.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
Says who?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Count me in.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No, I didn't know that.
No.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I love you, Lotte.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Did you see the reviews?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Great then.
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
What want ye, girl child?
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Then what do I do?
Not like He punished me.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Yes sir
In case of what?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
That was fun.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Oh I been out.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Never found out.
What yard? When who-
Who is she? Where she come from?
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Why me, man?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Yeah, it sucks.
Nothing.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Yeah, but we're--
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Huh?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Uh-huh.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Far out.
Different mothers, huh?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
On you, maybe.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Yeah man.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Take a look at this, sir.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
No it's fine, really, uh--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
What if it's during a game?
It's your roll--
Easy, Dude.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Whose toe was it, Walter?
But Walter--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Uh-huh.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Then what's...
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Are you employed, sir?
Dude.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
WHAT?!
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
I said out.  Now.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
This is a league game, Smokey!
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
I haven't forgotten.
Nothing.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not good.
I don't like it.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
I don't know about this, man --
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Wait.
How can you be out here?
You're joking --
He didn't. Get over it.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
There is no cure.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Some kind of archive --
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
For your miracle cure?
I'm not leaving without you.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
We weren't sure we could trust you.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
The Witch's voice.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
I don't know. Nightmare.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--bullshit!
Sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Whatever you want.
Why?
The, uh, blur there.
I can't.
Both. Now.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
--go!
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
I do.
What?
What're you doing with all this shit?
--Cotter: shut up.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--I don't know.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
No one ever comes here.
--who?
What?
I'm not finished.
Fine.
--now there.
Asleep--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
You planning on sleeping out there?
No. I don't think so.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Still working on it.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
--it's urgent!
Meurice--
Yeah.
What?
Yeah? What happened?
...You ever get tired?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah.
I think someone's watching.
About ten years.
I own the place.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Lubbock?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
No.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Got a job for you.
It's not strictly legal.
What do you think?
I want you to go fishing.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Nah, I trust ya.
You said the usual--
What.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
No.
Yes.
See my nipples?
No. please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
What?
Do you know?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Please. please stay.
Do you love me?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. are you?
I want you to stay with me.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Go where?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Yes.
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
I'm here, aren't I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Okay, Sandy.
No Jeffrey!!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
This is it.
Of course, Jeffrey.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
What?
He what?
Derek!
What is?
What is?
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
You're a fucking amateur!
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
For calling you a homo.
Not really, no.
Murder.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
It would be my pleasure.
Un sapo?
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
And Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
I'll tell her.
What do you guys want?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
I don't think so.
I like fire.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Dad.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
You swear?
Swear on my life.
It's alright, Dad.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Yes, I am.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
What?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
That's right.
The strike is a success; but ...
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Sid Ahmed.
I'll explain.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
How can I give you this statement?
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
So -- where do we start?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Why?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Cause?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
For about one year.
Intense.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
That's all Dr. Paley.
You called him?
We dated for about a month last year.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You know I can't talk about that.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Sure.  Where to?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
It's not my taste.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
It's only the beginning.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
No -- you're not.
You're a monster.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
That wasn't the deal.
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
I am relaxing.
Really?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Talk to me.
It was a place to start.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Sorry.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
It's not that long.
Oh Jesus.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
No treasure maps, huh?
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Michael.
Come here a minute.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
You're right -- that is sick.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Yeah.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Sure.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
What?
What?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Do you want to leave your husband?
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh, how is he?
Couple. Want to help?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
No. I can't. Not yet.
How about Italy?
Near the church.
No, I don't mind.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHY?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Sure.
I can't sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
I'm going to miss you.
Nah.
What's her name?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Climb out to where?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
I can't!
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Daddy?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
It was just like in my head.
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
That building?
But the place burned to the ground.
Ours!
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
All right!  Where's the key?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
Why?
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The money?  The money's gone.
But it could be anywhere.
This is insane!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What?
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
I had to.  You made me.
They were in a car accident.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Where's the fucking money?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Lick me.
Why?
Are you okay, Violet?
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Yeah.
This is the police, ma'am.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
I knew it.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
You have to ask?
I'm already in your bed.
I guess I wanted to.
Shit, here we go.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What choice?
You think I'm lying?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
Johnnie?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Trust me, Violet.
If he does ...
Not Caesar.
I won't.
Hey.
I'm here, aren't I?
Caesar wants me to stay.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
Right.
Yeah, I know...
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
Did you?
Get the fuck away from my car.
I want to go home.
You have blood on your pants.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
Then I'll find another ride.
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Where are we?
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I guess so.
...omigod, no...
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
-- forget it --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
You could do that?
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
So get the hell out of here.
My husband's out looking for him.
What?
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
Enhance it.
-- he accessed the account --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
I told you.  You need to rest.
Uh - what? - I ...
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... ere please.
... yer ducts.
What? How do you know my name?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Beginner's luck.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Well ... well, I ...
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
You sound worried.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
You killed him?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
I do. Goodbye. 
Shut up!
Bastard!!!
What?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Is it stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Oh.
It's my fucking life.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Well, terrorists of course.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
What?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Take care.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Don't worry.
The refund for Tuttle!
Next of kin!
27156789/074328/K.
What?
You are good to me Sam.
What's the matter?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You're not listening, mother.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
What? Who is this?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No need, sir
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
We'll be back.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. Wait here.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
We are virgins.
I should be going. I just quit.
Just take it easy.
You're going to live.
No.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
What did you say?
John, play the Sinatra.
I know him. That's Noel.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
She should go home.
How is she?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
The ghosts--
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I've taken that into consideration.
Who with?
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
No shit.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Faster!
You write this?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
And the rule was...
There are only ten.
What?
It's not loaded.
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
They booted me out of Washington.
London.  That's a promotion!
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Are you any closer to a decision?
Why?
Yes.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
No.  You know that I'm not.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
What is she shooting?
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Yes, there is.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
And Bobbie says...
Should I...
Bobbie, please.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
That's okay.
Okay.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
No.  Not even you.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I was a lot earlier.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
So great -- right?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Uh-uh.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
You fucking...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
A picnic?
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Uh-huh.
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Oh it's enough...
You're breaking my concentration!
Whaddya mean?
Righto.
A thing I made.
Honest?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Oh...
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Better!
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
There there...
Hm...
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Don't ask.
I do the research.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Didn't you hear him?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Dead Cat?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
I don't have another cat!
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Have a seat -
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
What, Mr. De Santis?
I-I already got a new one!
It was.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
No...look I'm busy...
You're like an undercover guy!
Huh?!!!
Smack?
You are?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Good morning Walter!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Why not?
What do you get?
Gee.  Thanks.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
I had him in my grasp.
What's with you?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I mean it.
What's playing there?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Yeah?
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.
I do?  I guess I do.
No...
I am so sure.
Hi there.
No, you're not.
Yeah?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Pretty shallow of you.
Get away from me!
) What do you think?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Where?
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Yes.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
This is it.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Oh.  Good.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
A what?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Vampires of the world, beware.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
They don't even have Dolby.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Thank you very much.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Sorry.
Oh.
I don't understand.
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
But --
Well, I hope so.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
What is she...
Oh, please.
Right!
Nice much.
Right.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I don't think so.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
No, no, it was great.
Yes I do...
I'm trying to play with your body!
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I think I'm ready for the Show.
I got lured.
He's a virgin.
We all deserve to wear white.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Yep.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
You okay?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I heard already.
What's it say?
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're a cocksucker!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
Go for it.
God--what a Big League move.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Then go.
My right.
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
We'll pray anyway.
Ain't he warning up?
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
It's a league record.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
...and one helluva guy.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Was I at that dinner?
I'm serious. No interference.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
What do you propose?
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Hold on a second.
Speeding?
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Right away.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
I don't know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
Between...
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Yeah.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
How do you do?
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I'll come by.
And they were usually right.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
I'm not crying. 
Yeah. Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
What do you need?
Yeah.
You can trust me.
Yeah, how do I know?
No, you don't.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
I gotta tell ya...
And...
Okay?
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
And where'd you go?
What did Jennifer have?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I'm not -
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
A record of the arrests...
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Well, I've been busy. 
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Hey!
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
I did - I didn't -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He's gone?
I'm over here now.
Oh.
Carmine left?
We can't help him if -
How are you?
I know.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Mm.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Yeah.
I don't - 
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
You did. You're right.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
All right. Be careful.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Get lost?
Come on! 
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I love you.
You do?
Lester - he called you here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
'Go! Go! Go!'
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
You're driving me nuts!
They check in alone?
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
Two.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But he never talked.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
It's up to you.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Angelo and Buster.
They'll do it.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No, no, no, no!
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You sure?
Mr. Chairman -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
It's okay. Let her go.
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
This looks promising...
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
You're probably right.
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Even the skylight?
What about "climbing in?"
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Why am I still troubled...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
And...your point?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
But of course you are.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
What?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
But I'm blind.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
It's taken care of.
Not this minute.
Bullshit.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You won't disconnect.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
And that was the end of it?
A price on everything.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
You're all three of you in that van?
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L.A.P.D.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
A typical fuck-up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Why are we stopping?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Naturally.
That's not good enough.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
There are no guarantees in this life.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Got a phone in that van?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
You'll see her.
Talk to the man.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
My pleasure --
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I won't let 'em.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Put the girl on.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Yeah.
So who's he?
I'm sorry.
Did he?
An excellent quality.
I would expect he does.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
You heard me --
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
He's Scottish, Col.
Like what?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Did you do that to him?
Like you're concerned.
He did sometimes.
No...
Dil --
Sorry.
Stop it, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Delirious.
Not here.
What's her?
Kind of.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
You could say that.
I'm not sure.
Anything.
Afraid so.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Yes.
For me.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Jimmy?
Did you hear me?
No.
I suppose I tried.
Stop it, Dil --
I like you, Dil --
I like you, DIl
Yes.
Anything.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Will I see you again?
Thirty-five.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Horny bastard.
He's all right.
I know.
Suits you.
What do you mean?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you don't?
Do you want a cup of tea?
I told him.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Definitely unusual.
Good. So what do you think?
So, what do I look like?
Am I?
No fucking way.
What is it now?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
What?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
The fastest.
Tree.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Give us a break.
Shut up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Like what?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
No.
What you say, faster?
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You didn't?
People. They could be looking.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
You're crazy --
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
How was I leading you on?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Lord, you're stubborn.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
With whom? Where?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Agent.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
But --
That's not Carson Dyle.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
1944. The next face, please.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Brian.
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Then who does?
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see my passport?
Which one are you?
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
There, you said it.
Okay.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Tuesday.
No.
I'm sorry.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well!
I don't believe it.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
The kid said --
Stop it!
He didn't have one.
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this? And this?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
We won! We won!
Why, do you think we're going to?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Don't you understand French?
Starting tonight?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How would you like a spanking?
Good night.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
How do you know what they're doing?
What are you talking about?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
The American Embassy.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
I never fucked Rod.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
No.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
Calm down Brent.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
It can't be.
Are you sure?
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Who?
Why?
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Stag?
I can't right now.
No.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
This party is sick.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Attacked how?
Why not?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
I got to go.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
Oh...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Peace.

I got, like, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.

I'm gonna stomp your a--

...excuse me.  Can you fix this?

You stole this truck.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I ain't playin' that.


Okay.
Kiss my ass!
 No...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
 Yeah...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

All right, you got it.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Oh, shit.

So I took his truck, yeah.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
I mean, if that gun was...
...shit.
...split.

Huh?

Okay. 


...they come!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 

Let's go!

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo.

Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
 big balls.
...about him.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Thank you.

Take it easy, Jake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
A ruler?
It doesn't hurt.
Probably.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
My daughter.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
You sure this is okay?
Well you own a lot of land.
The apple core club.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Oh yes.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Didn't you call?
Yeah?
You accusing me of extortion?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
I said I'll drop it.
I don't want to drop it.
Oh... thank you.
Well, how much would you like?
I have?
I was grateful.
Why?
Did he know?
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
That your maiden name?
No. I'm just a snoop.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Oh.
The Valley?
No.
No, I think I'd remember.
And Hollis knew about it?
What? What is it?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Sure.
Where's the girl?
What did you do that for?
What the hell is this all about?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
...so that's why you hate him...
With us.
Okay...
A Miss Sessions calling.
Of course.
Oh, good.
I'm sorry, I --
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when I breathe.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Yes...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Well, no.
Never.
What about the water?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
Since lunch.
Yes. No.
He owned it.
Yes.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She ran away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
You don't say?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
It tastes wonderful!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Why? What do you mean?
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...

That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Two cents.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
That's a long story.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
He made an awful lot of money.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Who said anything about brooms?
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Yes.
September the ninth?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Ask them to sit down.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Hmm!
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  But you're close.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
Susan, it seems to me -
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Good.
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Look out that window.
I've got to think of Emily -
I'll get you some coffee.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Yes.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
What do you mean by that?
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Are you serious?
What the hell is that?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Can I watch?
No, this is great.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
No, don't!
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
So you're really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
What?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Jesus, you're caustic.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
But can we date?
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Let me take you out tonight.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I'm just kidding.
I left like an hour ago.
Excuse me?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
In a second!
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
So I'm told.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Annoying Customer.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
Why are the shutters closed?
You called Caitlin again?
What do you two fight about?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Oh, my God.
You know what I just watched?
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
All of them.
Why not?
What?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
Can we not talk about this?
Yeah, right.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
An embarrassing way to die.
How'd he die?
That's embarrassing?
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Listen to you.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Shut the fuck up!
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
Leave me alone.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'm her sister.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
How much can you bench?
Yeah.
No, she's getting married.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
One seventy-nine.
Nothing personal.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Maybe.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Hunhh? Nothing.
She called you, didn't she?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
How many what?
Twelve.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Please calm down.
Something like thirty-six.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Sure.
I don't want Caitlin...
Veronica, I love you...
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
What?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
No way.
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
That's sick, Dante.
I like the way you think.
How long you gonna be here?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
He didn't ask me to...
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Bye. 
That woulda been cool.
More bang for the buck.
I don't know.
I admit, I can be bought.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Hey, fuck you.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I did what I thought was right.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Flare up of old emotions...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Hal knows what he's doing.
Can't do it.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Next time, date only basketball players.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Never
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
I won't do it.  No way.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
What are you talking about?
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
There.  You blind?
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Good morning, Walt.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
No. She's dead!
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Well - I'm back.
Aye.
Oh, aye, aye.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Lice?
Through there for a bath.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
How're you feeling this morning?
We're going to friends now, sir.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
You mean like going to the pictures?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
You got a deal.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I think...
Can you finish on schedule?
Very generous.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Elvis?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
What's he sayin'?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Who the hell is this?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Oh.  Sorry.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You always stutter?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
Yeah.
I think so.
Who was he?
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
What difference does it make?
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Doesn't cover everything.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
You're full of shit.
That's the reason?
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Who?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Do you still ride?
You bit someone's nose off?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Them who?
Nothing is easy.
Do they have a secret handshake?
Believe you about what?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
I've been reading up on it.
Never heard of him.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Is this your dad?
Is he dead?
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here in Manhattan.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
What?
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Because he believed me.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I can't promise you anything.
Now she tells me.
That's great.  Good for you.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Only on the football field.
We're very specialized.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
You do recognize it then?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Agent Lowry?
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Your call.  Have a good night.
Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
With me.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
What would you have me say, David?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's beautiful.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Because I can't.
That's my scientist.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
The librarian... or the library...?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
That's what they all say.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
And?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Make that two.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Can you try?
What'd you think?
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Recommendations?
Git movin', I said.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
We work down in the ditch?
Here, Mom.
Yeah.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I don't know, Boss.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
She's got him! You hear that?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You jes' watch us!
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Thass right. Just play it...
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Call.
Damn.
No. No chains either.
None of your fucking business.
What did I do?
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
Hal has it.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
When was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
No.  Not yet.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
How did you know they were stockings?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Then what do you need me for?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They get fan letters...
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
I'll get a locksmith.
What else?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Honest to God, Ruben!
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Shut up.
Right.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
You should have gone to the funeral.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
You're not envious?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Hard to say.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Really?
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
What's the matter?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
I didn't say...
I ruined your wedding night.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
When did you start smoking?
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Green spot.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
By color.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Anything interesting.
So are you engaged, or what?
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Lie down.
Do you?
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
So, it's over?
Aren't you ever quiet?
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Yeah?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
And all the plans we have.
Letty, please.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I'm calling in sick.
No, it's not like that.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
No, no.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No...
I heard about your friend.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Office work?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
You killed her!
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Good.   I'm good.
No thank you.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
We can't.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
What about the money?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
What'd you get?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You better.
What do you want now?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
What?
You said don't do it, boss.
Everything?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What is it you do, Sami?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
We've got to get out of here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Me?
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
God, I want to go home.
No.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Where is it, Sophie?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Thanks.
The lucky ones.
It's not your fault.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
After last night I could say the same for you.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I do as I please.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I owe you nothing.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Don't bother.
He is my defeated foe!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Perhaps.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
Have you questioned him yet?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
But Wudan does not accept women.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
But don't be too lenient.
A murderer?
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
We must avenge mother!
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
What do you have in mind?
Care for a hot dog?
I knew that.
No further.  I'm serious.
I saw it, too.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
I don't know you...
Victims.  Aren't we all.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Shelly?
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
18k.  Crap.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
No shooting.
I don't think so.
You might say that.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You what?
You didn't show it to anybody?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
That's a matter of opinion.
Thank you.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Not at all. Have a seat.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Yes.
I think that's for the best.
Hi.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Do you want to learn or not?
Okay.
I don't know.
Why?
It's Kathryn.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Well... not exactly.
I am?
Just taking your photo.
I swear.
I know.
I know.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You do?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Baby?  Right on time.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
And you think she bought it?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Outstanding.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
What?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Be more specific.
Shhh.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Yippy.
Kind of.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Mock, mock, mock.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
I have a flair for drama.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
And if I don't?
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
That's beautiful.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know when she'll be back?
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
What are you talking about?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
How?
Sometimes.
Do you know the people?
What's her name?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Well, it seemed to me --
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
What?
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Because she is my friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Don't cry, Amy.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Yes, Amy.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
That's the clever way to do it.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Why hasn't he got a head?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Go on -- out with you.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
At Victoria's Secret.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What else is there?
Nearly four.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
So don't look in his eyes.
Only to see.
I don't know.
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
It is so hot in here.
No they're not.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
And he was missing an arm.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
I think I already have.
I guess you'll find out.
About Mark? Carlton?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
So pee? Here?
Your desk.
No?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Briefs.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
A man killed in Central Park.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
What? Is there someone else?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, take it.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We can just take this pillowcase.
You're some catch Lloyd.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Just visiting my patient.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
How could you have been so stupid?
Sorry, sir.
What?  Who has?
What is going on?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Wait, this isn't fair...
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
I'm nothing then.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
We are...  living in their dreams...
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Right.
Don't worry.
I promise.  I won't.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
What the hell is this ?
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
What about containment, Alan?
And...
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Sort of... Yeah.
So what do we do?
Extend things?
I'm not sure... I might have.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
What?
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Perceptual?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
What?
I can't say.
Yeah.
Certainly.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I don't understand.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
All set.
Leave him.
Come on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.

Don't come.

Women swoon!
Hey, this is great.
Garden?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I think you're sweet.
What?
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
That's not my fault.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm in.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
Sort of.
No.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Then come with me.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.

Yawp!

Don't stop!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Okay.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Yes sir.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Todd Anderson.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
what?
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
I'll come to the performance.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Which question is that?
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
I have a schedule...
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
That's where my boat's moored.
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Quite a few.
Anti social?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Right... You have a boat.
Keep tasting...
Yeah...
I don't take orders at all.
You ain't giving the orders here!
So?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...

You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?

Nothing.
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!

Yeah.
Get the boots.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
John,we're going huntin'.
They did not!
Vince thinks... you know...
She does not!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Oh. Fine.
You know a guy named Merle?
Who's got the ammo?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Linda, Linda...!
I don't know! I don't know either!
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Up north.
Nick.
No. No, no.
I want to go home, Merle.
There's Vince!
The shot?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
From Nam?
Pow.
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
What else?
What do you mean?
Merle...
You wanna bet?
Then lemme have 'em.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Never one.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Put that on your political resume.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.

Doucet killed my partner.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
I'm signing off.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
He lied to me again.
I didn't.
It hasn't opened yet?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
No! No! I won't.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Howdy, Hank.
Sure am.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Some other time, Stevens.
You are afraid!
But what becomes of our souls?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Look here now--
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
About what?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Not long -- now.
There's no joy in it for me.
Shall we?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
You want me to go around --
Why not -- ?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Tired?
I'll get it, Jabez.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Jabez!
All right, Jabez ...
Consarn the consarn --
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
It don't matter!
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
I won't forget.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
The past six months.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'll find someplace.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
I'm a cop from New York.
Put it down now.
I'm going to count to three...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Oh...Where does he live?
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Two?  Are you sure?
I'm here, cowboy.
I...I shot a kid.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.

Yessir.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
No.  I never smile any more.
Yes, I would.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
I'm sorry...
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Do you still want the operation?
Well, then...
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
They were ...
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Give me the keys...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I took too long.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Mulvaney...
If you take anybody, please take me.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Special to me, too.
I'm sorry.
Would I hire you?
Yeah?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
All right ... send them the guard.
What kind of a deal?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Yeah ...
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Okay, when do I get them?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
Doing what?
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?

But maybe not.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Eddie, how was I?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
This is kind of a stream--
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Better than not getting a job?
Oh, just like in the script!
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
You could say that --
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Oh, of course!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
But Greta say --
Okey-dokey.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Tits.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
I am.  How's your father?
Not good...
I just picked them up on the way over...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Bela died.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Who's Dr. Tom?
Yes?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
What's uncanny?
Lines around the block.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Yes!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Anything good?
Come on...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What?
Cool.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Welcome to work, Ed.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Okay ...
Oh... how come?
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Yeah, well...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Why?
What?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
No... Could you?
Everybody's someone.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What is?!
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Screw off.
Ray --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Who's Shari?
No problema.  You want a picture?
Ed... I'm sorry.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Here, get down.
Yeah, just --
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Hello, Tracy.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
I did it.
Door was open.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Dave.
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
What do you mean?
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Larry, you just take it easy
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
What?
What do you mean?
Sure, Tracy.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
It's not what you think.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
That simple, huh?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
How?
How'd you get them to retract?
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Lynn.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Of course...
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Clean?
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Why?
And now you'll provide them.
What's this all about, lad?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
I want to do it right.
Bud White's been here?
What's her name?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I know how he feels.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Yeah, it's subtle.
I just called it.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
I'm telling you, I--
Who are you calling?!
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Told by whom?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
How do you know so much?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Those are Feds.
That wasn't so hard.
We're not gonna hurt you.
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Because I don't know.
To buy lingerie.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
How could you let me find out like this?
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I know.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
That's okay.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
It's a brand new card.
Sir?
Oh.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
He doesn't work that way.
Eat your fish.
Will you hang on just a second.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We're screwed.
I'm sorry about that.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
My shoe?
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Fuck off.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
The blender?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Table 122?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Jerry?
Bobby--
I don't know.
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Hiding something?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Sir--
I just meant--
You're kidding me.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Yes sir.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
As the wife of one of our party.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Oh my God, the others!
Good.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Don't go over it again, please.
No.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
Appropriate?
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
What?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
In my room.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Shut-up!
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I don't know what that means.
And you've forgotten yours.
Moose.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
For?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Off with his head!
Oh really?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Aren't you?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I can already see.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Because I'm a nurse.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Your friend?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
K is for Katharine.
Why?  Is he staying?
You'd better be.

I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
I try not to expect you.
Of course.  When?
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
A toddler
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I'm feeling old.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Then you were married?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
We're getting close.
I don't know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'm in the middle.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Who am I?
Uh. I'm showing off.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
I sincerely hope so.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Possibly.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
Good morning.
We go underwater?
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It was a long time ago.
Little celebration before we set off.
It's a party.
Got it.
Duh.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
And the money goes--
A parting gift from the Empire.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You've thought of everything.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
The disc is still in there.
Get out of here!
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
You damn well thought wrong.
Check out my ball.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
All of 'em?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
You're a lawyer?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Don't bother.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
They skipped that step.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Not in my world.
No one's taking anything --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
How do you know that?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Yesterday.
Did he say why?
And ...?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Why not?
How?
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I'm just saying --
How would you know?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
That is not what I'm --
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Mm-hm.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I will.  Bye.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Next week.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
The boy is our last hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I can help them!
And that is why I must go.
Barks and growls at his boss.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his agreement.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
No lightspeed?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Can you trust him?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Thanks to you.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
What is it?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
But I feel The Force flowing!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They suggested oranges.
And we can watch ...
Please
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Go on now. Do as I say.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
I'm here.
It's history. I gotta go.
So where's Plissken?
No way.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Where?
Who?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
So be it.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Love demands it.
We are to blame.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
You didn't ask!
Fuck it.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Hi, how'd your day go?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What didn't he tell you?
Me too.
Please.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
What's her name?
Really? wow.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Fine thank you.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention her.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Please.
In Europe.
What?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
When can I have one?
Yeah.
Here I'll show you.
I don't know
Well you know it's okay.
What?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
I came to say goodbye.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
In here. With us.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Okay
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Her heart.
I once did a paper on it
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Yeah, a fall.
No I probably wouldn't.
O'Lord hear my prey.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him!!!
Yes.
Twelve.
It's our goddamn car!
Little slow tonight.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Suit yourself.
Baker.
No bones?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Two nights.
My pleasure.
Am I late?
What's the point?
Frank.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You got weird kids, Frank.
So do I.
You'll see.
It's me.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I didn't get her number.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
How about these?
So what do you think?
A few bars!
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Right.
No, you take the right.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Christ, can't you hear it?
Because I can hear it.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Fine.
What?
Celebrating.  Join me?
You always threw up.
You could've come.
I can't make the tenth.
No.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Yeah.
Just call me a cab.
All right.
The flu.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Yes, it is.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
They're nines.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
What?
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
He leads, I follow.
I suppose.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Must've been a cheap date.
Oh.
Coffee?
There's always another girl.
You don't pick your brother.
Huh?
Losing his teeth.
What are they?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Should be.  It's yours.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
We need to talk.
Must've been after we got engaged.
So you had a nightmare.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
What more proof do you need?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Shoot him!
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Janie?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
That's your name, isn't it?
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
-- I've got to study.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
-- Studying.
So you left her?  Just like that?
I don't know.  Maybe...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
What’s going on here?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Where’s my real dad?
Who did?
Check...
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
It’s just two kids, right?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
It’s me, Jack...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
I've got everything I need.
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
Thanks.  To you too...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Because that’s where I live.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
Because you’ll be here.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
Uh huh...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
Worse, you mean...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
It’s like a museum.
Think bigger.
What are you talking about, Jack?
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Are you okay, Jack?
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
That’s the one...
Not with what they pay me...
Jack.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
So we'll get egg nog.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
And you can?  Power it up?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
What do you mean "complete"?
That's terrible news...
I can go hotter!
They're not costumes.
But all these people...
Not this again --
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
That's what we're here to find out.
Are you kidding?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
And reverse the mutations --
Of course.  Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Susan.  What are you doing?
Here's the overall Target Area...
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Medical's ready.
No...
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, Cora.
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
We're pushing oxygen today.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
That's what they pay me for.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Quite a piece of plumbing.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
No, there's no other way.
Then why not take it?
At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
Well, we better get on with it.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
That line was tampered with...
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Where we going?
Sort of.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
No Jean, no money!
I don't think so. It's nice.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Yeah, you already said that.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Personal matters.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
You have children?
Oh, he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Uh-huh.
Oh sure.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
In what way?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
And what about the other fella?
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
No. No, ma'am.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, I see.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir? Right now?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
My patience is at an end.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah.
Whatcha watchin' there?
You told me about it.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I know it's a lot.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Yah.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Yah?
Yah.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Well, they're a good outfit.
It's okay...
Yah, is this Marge?
Norm?
Yah.
- looking.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh, fine.
It's terrific!
I love you, Norm.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Well -
Where's Tyler?
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Look at my face.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
No, I wasn't aware...
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
Really?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I suppose.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Goodbye.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
What do you get out of it?
What?
Answer the question!
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What... ?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Oh, yeah.
You fucking slut!!
Tyler Durden.
No, supply oxygen?
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
...no ...no ...
A hotel?
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Call what off?
Hum.
If you could fight any celebrity?
No.  Not at all.
I'm fine.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Yes, I promise.
Don't mention me.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
You quit?
Fucking sweet.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
You know what I mean.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
I quit.
Yes.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Not exactly according to plan.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
You need me.
... no, no, no...
What?
Maintenance.
You told me you'd say that.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
You and your friend.
Please, God, no...
Why?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Signs?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I...I...
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Speed up.
I have to save Eugene!
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Taken care of.
Random, sure.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Nice try, kiddo.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Right. April 25th.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Most kids never have it happen.
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
You're the fuckin' devil.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
"Next?"
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
What just happened?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Where's your stuff?
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Yeah...
I need a vacation.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I couldn't get you in.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Sorry, Sir.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
That's right.
What?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Colonel.
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Well, there's nobody special!
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
How have you been?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Tragedy?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You can ask.
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
My name is Parry.
They're --  -- What?
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Can I take you to lunch?
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
The Red Knight!
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
OWW...MAN...
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Serveza yourself!
Out where?
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You treat me like I was.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Do you love me, Bobby?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Palm Apodaca.
Where are you going?
How do you know it's clean?
I didn't get it, did I?
No. How much do I owe you?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Now don't...
You know who it once belonged to?
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
I don't know.
No, thanks...
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
At being a fake.
Is he?
What?
Catherine...
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What?
What?
All right, let's have a rematch.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
It is true.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Jesus, what a rude person...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
There's some good things on it, though.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Victor.
No.  What you do today?
You look good.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't!
Wussup, Victor.
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Yeah.
Positive.
So, then whadda ya want?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Just relax....
No idea.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Affirmative.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Come on in.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Who?
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure those doors will be open?
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Yeah.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
No, thank you.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Preoccupied with what?
I love the outfits.
I have this effect on lots of women.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Hi.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
God...
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Why did you do it?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Lock's busted.
She moved out.
Irwin...
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
What?  Who the hell are they?
What...
Frieda's boss.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
So you...
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
No prob...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
You're not funny.
Johnny's C.D.?
How much?
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Ye-ah.
Ye-ah.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Julian, you're fired.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
I'm clean.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
He is not wrong.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Mmm.
You're for real?
Fake it.
He got off on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Pour it in your ear.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Third time around.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Darling, may I have this one?
What is that old building?
Well, I think you do.
Nothing.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Well, why not a little of the King?
The usual.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you more.
I know.  He loves that thing.
I'm serious.
Luck, my ass.
I think you know, Frank.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Wait...
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Uh huh...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
W...B...2...YXB.
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
What if it's not...
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I lost you.
Fire.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
I'm right here, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Dad, you there?
Sully!  Is that you?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
So how are things at the hospital?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Barely.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
This is all the exercise I need...
Will you come with me?
Why?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
What?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
May be please have the wallet.
Keep looking.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Damn you, Shelly!
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
I wish it was.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Daddy, what is going on?
Wait a minute. I just...
I hope so.
No more.
I found it outside.
Are they grown-ups?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Boy scouting.
Will you listen, dammit!
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Please don't do anything crazy.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
So let's talk.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
It's going.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
Sorry.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
I'm now begging you.
About what?
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Never.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Ask me in about five minutes.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Rennie's not coming.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
We have to get off this ship!!
Nothing.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
What are you talking about?
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
He is not.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
We changed our minds.
What did you find?
She wants a divorce.
It's over, finished and done with.
Do not inhale.
What do I exude?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
What was it like?
Do we care?
I say we go.
Here we go.
Then you should carry a gun.
That was a big mistake.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
This could be it.
About what?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
A flat-out hit.
Yes.
Mystery. Deception.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Joanne Bourne.
She's my gynecologist.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
I can't find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
Show him who we are.
Oh yeah?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a simple subject.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're out of bullets.
You're not making sense.
I have excellent long-term memory.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I think I remember.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I hear good things about the new play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
I thought you were a man of God.
A -- a week.
It was one incident.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I hope not.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He's "discovering" India.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Now is your chance to find out.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Something's not right.
Often.
Thank you, no.
Again?
What's wrong with him?
Six one.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
You know I'm scared of heights.
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
I'm sure I could have.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
How long?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
How tall are you?
Why not?
No.
They found an eyelash.
You celebrate, Jerome?
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Those checks take forever.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
I can't do this.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I'm not doing it.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Stay clean.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
No way. I've got to get out now.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
After four years and now the question comes up.
I'm still here, Doc.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Sure.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
For exits off Main Street.
At least you were outside.
Bullshit.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
What do we do?
And switched keys.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Fifteen minutes.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
I don't want to hear it.
Whatever happens it's over.
I don't see how.
What's wrong?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Oh my God.
You were with him?
Wire pull over?
Whatever you need.
Aren't we going a little hard?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Just fine.
And I keep my mouth shut?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
That right?
How long have you been married?
I know.
How?
When did you find out?
How?
'Good.'
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
That's nice.
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Yes.
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
What?
Yes, I do.
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
We're there now.
Especially when I play the lead.
Not entirely. No.
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
No.
Working at Woolworths.
Yes.
Thanks.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Large Scotch.
Where you off to?
Who's Brumby?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Don't ask me.
That little shit!
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
It would be. If they were still living.
That's all right, Eric.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Still got your sense of humour.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Piss off, Ray.
But they have to be diplomatic.
Knock it off, Gerald.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Shut up.
Where am I going to work?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
I...I don't know.
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
Eh?
No.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Huh.
That's what I...
What?
What? 
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Well.  Well...
Not actually, no.
What did you say?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
What does that mean?
What if you don't get caught?
No.
...and rob the place...
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
It's a waste of time.
What?
To the cops?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
I was at home, where were you?
Was I?
No.
No.
Why?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Just go to lunch.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
...after the thirtieth...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Good.  Now we're talking.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Well, hadn't it?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Like you taught me...
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Sure.
Which...
Home cooking...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Three days.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
We're going to speak to her.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Fuck the Machine.
You did that?
They didn't get my contracts.
Some of them...
Yes.
If you don't want it, give it back.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Three.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
I got lots of presents.
Just a few days.
Some day you will.
I'm not hungry.
That's right.
We have no money for a rug.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Because I need MONEY!
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
No, Dad.
We're making an investment in Havana.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
And you believed that story.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
What?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
 And he agreed?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
She's gone, Tom.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I took care of it.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
That plane goes to Miami...
No questions.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
I don't think that's necessary.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Sleeping inside me.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
You haven't heard me.
Right here.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
I deny his every charge.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
And?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
The same assurance we got from you.
We got friends in the commission.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Yes.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
You liked it too.
You mean us?
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Why?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
What do I do?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Mornin'.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Broke is more like it.
You don't say?  Which picture?
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
All right, I guess.
This David's a friend?
Did you now?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Something happened to him?
You're the one who started it.
David produced her last picture.
Good.  Let's get dry.
No.  Definitely not.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'm very sorry.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
What did you expect?  Bronze?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
There are straps in back.
All right.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Good.  Fine.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Yes?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
A visitor.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
No.  I expect you can't.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Sit?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
I don't want him hurt...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
What for?
You know my back -
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Something like that -
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
You, too, Ma...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Oh, for God's sake
You've been pre-booked...
What do you say, Toby?,
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Don't go there, Toby --
Hello, Memphis --
You, too
Yeah --
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I know. I've missed you, too
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Now, we go -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Where we going -- ?
For real?
What are you doing here?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Mitch.
Six or seven...
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
What's wrong with her -- ?
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
No. Open her ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Hello, Otto ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
And the moral of that story is -- ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
You sure I can't go with ya?
Not really --
Shit all looks the same here --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Wha?  Me?
Why would I get into that?
Nods again.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
How much?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy.
There are cops all over the place.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Will you stop.
He heard.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No, no. It's okay.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What? Come on!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
All right, then.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Fuck you.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Gone.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Shut up.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
That's right.
--Half-red, half-black--
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Uh-oh.
I did.
I've been busy.
Since Nancy died.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
Me too.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
What did you think?
Nautilus?
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
You're kiddin' me.
I guess.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
I'm Will.
Okay, sounds good.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
No.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Do you know all their names?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Clearly.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
At least you have a mother.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Naw. They paroled me.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Got a warrant?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Say, who runs this place?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Goodnight.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
They never wrote you nothing?
What you figger to do?
I don't know.
I ain't gonna run.
I aim to.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
This here's a strike.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Take her with you!
I'll walk back.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Then what, Tom?
Good-by, Tommy.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
We can pick anything.
Yes I do.
It's what I do.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
I'm a professional killer.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Get the fuck outta here.
That's probably a good idea.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Up on the right.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Okay.
Hey, Bob.
Those all seem kind of related...
Nope.
I don't think so.
He using her.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There's nothing to be done about it.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
See you next week.
I spoke to your father the other day.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Paul?
Work's good for the soul.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
It is cocktail hour yet?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Does Chicago count?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
What?!
I don't care! We'd be together.
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Fine!
Mom?
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Whatever you want.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Hi.
Well, one was for salad...
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Tom?
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
My period.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Go ahead...
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Tch. What are you --
I love you.
Yeah.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Take your time.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
No. He had the choice.
She calls him Tommy...
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
We still have a way to go.
I understand...
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
How long were you married?
Sometimes.
Honey... I was always good.
Don't move!
Alright sir.
Waste the dude.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
I'm gonna hit you!
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Yeah? Display?
Mm-hmm.
Revenge.
And unpack.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
That's bullshit.
How did you know that?
Burn!
What's this one eat?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Fucked if I care, man.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Are you challenging me?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
I know, I know who wrote it.
It's my subway defense system.
Yeah.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
Cancer?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Joey, Joey...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Excuse me?
What, it left a note?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Real charmer.
All right.
This morning.
Don't get angry.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Not without Jamie.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
You guys always look great.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
How many bodies did you find?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Yeah, hurry up.
Then we'll be safe?
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
What are we doing?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Dear God.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Be here in a minute.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Car trouble?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
What's this big, big news?
Annie!
Come with me.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Promise?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Sure.
After the movie.
There is no such thing.
No! Do as I say.
Will you get her for me?
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Mm-mm!
Oh, listen...
I can't believe it!
Are you really interested?
Oh--
You want to see some?
A lot of works.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Yeah.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I cry at the opera.
And it ruins everything else.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Let's take a look.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Like what?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Hi.
Uh-huh.
Well, are...are they big?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Ed Smythe, yes.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
No?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh.
Yes, he's just adorable.
What are you doing?!
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I didn't sleep all night.
Oh, all the time.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
I know!  I know!
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
But, you got four children!
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
Oh, honey!
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mmm...
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Based on what?  You never even see him.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Because I have to!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
I'm sorry.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Yeah?
Hello?
Like what?!  What?
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
How are you?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Oh...
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Football!
Is there no chance?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
True.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
It's, uh, you never know--
Singing?
Really?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Yeah, that's clerical.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah.  Me, too.
I remember you.
We didn't hit it off.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, who cares?
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Hmm.
...read it over, and think about it.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I have not read you your rights.
Or, perhaps...
It's a growth business.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Say it in English.
...they did it for a lark.
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...would you excuse me...?
What's up...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
No. 
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
...and my need for The Institution...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
You're <u>free</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...what has she done to harm you...?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I know it well.
...but:  this particular statue...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Yes.
What is your point?
I..
Yes.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
What are you gonna do about it?
You're all making me blush...
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Goodnight.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
So what?                                                    ]
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yes you do.
Don't worry, you...
It's been known to happen.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Do you really think I care?
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week.

Don't get cocky, girl.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
What are you doing here?!
Color me nauseous.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
How very.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
S'okay....
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Next channel, darling.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
French.
Incredible similarity.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I think so, man.
May<u>be</u>.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
That's three things.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
playfully shoves his hand away.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
sighs.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
It doesn't matter.
You're such an incredible woman.
That idiot boarder?
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Second most common?
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
I said she's been missing for-
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
But... I thought...
In a word? Lucrative.
What?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
It's perfect.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
A little? Try unbelievably.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
YOU!
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Right.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
It's November.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Lie, you mean...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
That's not what I mean...
John, I know all about it.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Whoa, check it out.
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Sure.
Just show me the way.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
What's that?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Oh baby.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
What about cable?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Not now.  I'm busy.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
That doesn't matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
I would like to say goodbye.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
A lucky guess.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
I'll be fine.
Who was that man last night?
New York is dangerous place.
About what?
I know.
I wanted to get to know you better.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
What?  How?
We'll see.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
I can take care of myself.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
No.  The money, please.
I think he's dead!
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
You won't die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
What are you talking about?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
I overheard him with the girl.
What hospital?
You said they would be here!
Where is it?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Be quiet!  Listen!
I know.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
What are we going to do about Mike?
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Just one question.  Please.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
I know the one.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Go, Mickey.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Yes, sir.
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Not until the man calls.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I thought they locked you in your room.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You can let go.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
That's what I came to talk to you about.
There is nothing to it.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
What's happening?
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
The police are very busy.
The front gate would be best, General.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No, sir.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Oh my God!
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Just drive, Gregoire.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
What cards?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
I need a great favor.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
The third floor are low class rooms.
He wants your wisdom.
Homework?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
But who is left?
In Ruhengeri?
Why?
I want to know.
No! Sit down now.
We are almost out of everything.
Please do not talk like this.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
Many beers.
Can I help you?
What is his room number?
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Yes.
The...Fourth of July.
Prove it.
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
Let's try down here...
He's gotta still be down here.
For chrissake give me a hand!
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- I pose you the same question --
Maybe if I --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
-- confirming everything we already know --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
I can't comment until I get paid.
Why not?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
You say you saw some activity here?
What's the matter?
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
By killing them?
I don't understand.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
Where is she?
He's blessing the house.
That's great, honey.
Daddy help!
Good night daddy.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
You didn't think much about that before.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Should I...
What?
I'm ok.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
It was a shame.
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
How can I help you?
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Yes, they are.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Then tell me what to do.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Right.  Right!
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
And he still sits there?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No.  We want ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
But how in God's name ...
Really?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
You re not thinking of going to...
But I said I was sorry....
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Last rites, sister?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Yeah.  The big E.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
How long were you in?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Like a "cat", one could say.
We're here to say, your government was right.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
I guess that's a no.
What job?
You certainly do.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Hipster!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Adenoids?
Yeah.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
I myself --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
-- or lack thereof?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
You know, on farm route 17.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Worked in a watch factory?
Norville!
Oh Norville, I --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Says who?!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
I --
Well, I --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
-- tough titty toenails!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
I --
You --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sir, my leg is on fire!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
She looks in her purse...
Maybe he's wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
He notices.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
You mean a figurehead.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
But you didn't have to come up here.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Yes -- on the boat.
It'll wait.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Did you hear what he sang?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
Yes, thank you.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
I imagined this so differently...
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Yes.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
Why shouldn't she be?
Hmm. Good night.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That shirt?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
See for yourself.
You think I --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
The phone's out.
Sure dad.
Stay out of trouble.
Ben--
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Birth control.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Jesus all right enough!
That's besides the point.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Well, we can talk about it.
With Mikey?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Educated guess.
They say you never forget.
Forget how to ride a bike.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Do what?
Am I right or am I right?
Major.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
No!
The Idiot?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Sure, anything but this English.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
With who?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Hey Sandy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Communist Viet Cong.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Don't worry about him...
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Twelve years younger.
I don't remember.
What time was that?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
No.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
To do nothing.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
Habit.
That's not what he thinks.
That's a long time.
You don't know.
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
Then so was mine...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Are you the leader of tis group?
Surely you know the one who made you...
Your lover.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Does it?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
And you never cried -
Not yet.
Yes...
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
How devilishly clever.
And no one knows but us...
Be still!
Never.
Yes...
But if she dies...
Then my luck would have changed.
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
How do you mean, start?
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Sure...
The crucifix -
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Paris? You came from Paris?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
That's all past, Lestat.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
But it has. There is no more to tell.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Yes!
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What about a radio?
Who? Who is here?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Karla! You promised.
Yes.
Some.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
What?
It beets being on the mainland.
It's...him.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I'll talk real slow.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Rio, baby!
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How much?
Must have missed the sign.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
She's in her room.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
All the graves?
I donut understand.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
No one can take my father's place.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Thea is an orphan.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
That your father and I ——
Really, this is idiotic!
You wouldn't tell that ——
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Yes?
I don't understand you.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her name is Thea?
Her family name?
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
Oh, now —— now look here ——
But that should make you like her.
We have no time for that.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
I'm hurrying.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
I hate to do this, fella.
What did . . .
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
George Bailey.
No!
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
I know. I know.
Thanks.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
When'd you see him last?
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Uh-huh.
Hee-haw!
All in . . .
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Oh, George!
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
No.
Aw, forget it.
Okay.  What's yours?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Have a good time, son.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Five hundred dollars.
I'll take chocolate.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'm going to scream!
Tuesday.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Would you rather leave?
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
What?
Well, I don't know....
With butter, if they got any....
I think we're changing course a little.
Back down!
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
You're betting what you already got.
There's a shark....
Let's just go sailing, okay?
The rope!  The rope!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Please.  It's my job.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Every day?
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Not till next year.
I kind of had plans....
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Late.
Why?
Door's locked.
It's good with coffee.
Do you?
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
Mike's out there.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
What for?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Maybe.
Nope.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
What's that mean?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I can go out if I want to.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Might as well.
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Brody's riding his tower.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
You buying?
Hope I make it through both.
See you later.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Just put your mask on.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
... Me, too.
... Mean through the tubes?
Hydrophobia...
It's a shark's tooth!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Yes, aren't we all.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
So do I, love.
We're taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Should be coming out of it soon.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
She, Mister Hutton.
They still seem nervous.
Ten minutes ago.
Sure.
Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Can hardly wait to do it again.
SEAN!
Now what?
Aww, can't I keep it?
Precisely.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Right, Mike.
He needs a haircut.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
I want to see Kathryn.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
That bugger moves fast.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
He told me you both did....
We forgot to stop at the store.
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
I have work....
They're at the beach....
I don't know....
I'm not on vacation....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
He knows what he has to do....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
What's going on?
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
Thanks for the consultation....
I'll miss you....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
I'm not going to quit now....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Good.
I'm fine....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sure you can....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
No!
That's hard to imagine....
Won't you get in trouble...?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Yes I can....
You got a better idea...?
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
It needs more time to charge.
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop busting my hump....
Will you leave me alone...?
The readings suck....
You didn't stick them on right....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
Holy shit!
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
So far..
What she's got.  Nine knots....
As long as he's been here....
Hoagie.
I'm going down, Jake....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Anything to do before I go home?
Oh no--
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Only me and Mom ..
I hope I'm not intruding?
You heard. Look for the knife.
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Not too good in daylight ..
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Listen to me saying what?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Hey ..
I guess by the bed.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Once.
That's bullshit,
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
Wrong cabinet.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Do you pray?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I can't identify him ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Jerry!  Do something --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
No.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
You're imagining it.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh, tell the story.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
No no. I knew.
Hello?
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
Yeah, thanks.
Sure.
Mission... statement...
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Happy. He said "happy?"
Plus, you could use that commission.
I'm relieved you said that.
Right.  I'll come in.
Easy, easy --
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
So this break... is a break-up.
Of course I know --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thank you.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Said who?  Sugar?
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I understand your anxiety.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Fine.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
How do I know?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
How sad --
Don't be silly.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Dick.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
-- and I'll get 'em.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
No.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
This is how you play God.
What is it?
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
We have to help him.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
You couldn't have made that jump.
How low?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
DAD!
I thought you were an expert.
It won't hold!
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
KEEP GOING!
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Raptors, mostly.
No. I couldn't see.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
No.  I feel something.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
That was about a year ago.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Okay.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Isn't it obvious?
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
No way.
No.
I don't know.
Look!  Sarah!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why should they?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?!
You think this is all a joke?
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
The door security systems are shutting down.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Are you sure?
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
John....
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
We were right!
Dilophosaurus.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Stick to my heels.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Why not?
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
I get ah - -
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Hola, bienvenido
He sends his apologies.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
I doubt it.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Nope.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You have no idea.
Machines hate you?
The kids okay?
Kids get scared.
There's gotta be something - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Dorkatops!
All night.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Yes.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Yeah?
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Fuck you.
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Insomnolesence...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
That's open to debate.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Did you?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.
What an extraordinary request!
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
One of you must be mistaken.
I've never seen you here before.
I suspected that he -- well.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
He was murdered.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You don't believe that.
I don't know.
What makes you think so?
What did she say?
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
You mean you've actually begun some?
-- Just doing our job.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Then why haven't I been --
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
It usually is.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
And we're upset too.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Now Ann ...
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Value? ... Value?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
) They are now.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Compassion.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Please --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Don't belong?
Didn't want you.
Here please.
Yes.
Will you let me go then?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Well --
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I don't like getting splashed.
My bed.
Mm.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
No. I'm sore.
I better keep looking.
It's got to make sense some way.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Just send me a money order.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
All right.
I've just got a few --
Two years ago? Sorry.
She told me.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Then how are you involved?
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
Yeah.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
The prospect of losing my child.
In real life when does he hit you?
Welcome to the... 
Show...
On earth.
Wow!  French toast, really?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Dad?
I love you...
Yep.
Uh huh...
No, she never did.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Why does he decide?
Who will read me my stories?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Objection!
Eight, almost nine years.
Yes...
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What?
Fine.
Yes...How's Billy?
You have?
You've been living here, in the city?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
What?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
What?!?
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Fine.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
How the hell are you going to do that?
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I'm sure.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Again?
It is alright, Father.
Can I free the prisoners?
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
General Chiang.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
You could buy them.
Look here!
Britain?
And, America?
Where is that?
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Thank you.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Eliminate you.
How could I ever leave?
What would you do, Holiness?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Oh, yes.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
Mr. Cyr!
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Yup.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Get the gun.
You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
What's going on?
Are you sure?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Who?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I'd be able to see something.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Night.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
Look.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He's floating.  Take it home.
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Is the dead guy in there?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
It's just that--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I thought I saw...
You threw it at me!!
I asked you to be nice to him.
You think Jack's handsome?
Yes.
Look.
Wait.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
The somebody else part?
Why not?
Well, except for the one girl.
Hot damn, Clarice.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
I think so.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed your patient?
Mmm. And what else...?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
No! That's incidental.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Yes...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
You know I can't make that promise.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Did you breast-feed her?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
I'm sorry.
...never doubt what you are doing.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
"Some"?
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Dark haired...
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
We don't.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
: Only one or two loads.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
What did you see, Major?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Be my guest.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
He did.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
You screw around like that again and--
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
How much time does that give us?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
It bit me!
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Beautiful.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
Who cares?
Under there?
Two hundred meters.
What are you going to do to him?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Well what?
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
They were . . .
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Can I help?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Just carrying a bag.
Try that one.
That's no way to answer the phone.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
How about you? All right?
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Invitations?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
What do you mean, me?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
I'll only be a minute.
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
So?
They're not going to jail.
They stole our land--
You think I can't learn that?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
No, sir--
I do, sir.
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
That badge--
Yeah.
He swore by it.  What?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
That's in Maverick County.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
He never asked her.
No sir.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
You wouldn't?
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
It's a lead mine.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Have we had trouble there before?
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Aqui! [Here!]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
We have a daughter.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
You ever play one of these?
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
He's going to wish he was dead.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
What do you think?
So I've heard--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Couple months before I was born--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Been away. Up to Houston.
He's gonna find out.
Thirty-five bucks.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
A Nix specialty?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Right.
That's so cool.
Deep shit?
All right.  It was...
What about death?
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
It's him... it's him.
He's with us... He's with us...
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
And they all came...
Good.  There.  Yes?
Somebody killed him.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Maybe I just bought it.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Are you a believer, then?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
No.
I tried to pay you off.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
What's her problem?
Does anybody?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
It's me betrayed him.
Is that all?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Yes?
What?
No.
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
Yes.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
You're possessive.
No, yes, it does...
That's ok.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Because that would be too easy.
Oh, she'll love it.
Yeah, look at that thing.
No, we'll find something around here.
That's what you said the other night.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Ok, well... I love you.
It's just carpet.
What are you talking about?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
That's ok.
Bye.
Excuse me?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Bye.
I don't know.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Are you sure you have to go?
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Do you think they have a room here?
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I don't know.  What are they?
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Yes.  It's exactly...
And how would you describe him?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I think I should join you.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He will.  He has great faith.
I hope so.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Kelson, hold on a second...
What's his name?
Peter Kelson?
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
I had to.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Not a lot.
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Get out of here.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
Camille, she'll be fine.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You're a caterer?
You're cold?
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I'll take that as a compliment.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
I know this.  What do you want?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
With a jacked-up attitude.
You either.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Yeah.
Fine, Quincy.
What are we playing for?
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Here I am.
It happens, right...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Nobody.
The "man" again.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
A rest?
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
At one in the morning?
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Yup.
Sorry.  You okay?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Your door was unlocked.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
No.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Brain and Lung.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
You don't have a boyfriend?
Who was it?
You just move in here?
-- do you wanna cup?
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
What's that stand for?
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
...yeah...
I'm sorry.
What?
I've got troubles.
Yes.
Claudia.
It doesn't matter.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
-- no.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
That's confidential information, little man.
No.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
I ain't fuckin with you --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Might of been before my time.
-- Samuel Johnson.
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Yes.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It's ok.
Graduation?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Alright.  Thank you.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
Go ahead and waste your time.
I'm quietly judging you.
Around here.
She's retired.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
From '84 to '89.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
...are you Phil...?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
Yeah.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I didn't hear anything.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Are you alright?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
How long with Paula?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Did you ever touch her?
I really don't know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
You're her boyfriend?
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Yes. What? Yes.
We need more dog food --
I need this one.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
I'm fine. nothing.
I don't know.
Yes.
Go to bed.
I have money.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
This happens....this is something that happens.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
No, Louis!  No!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
I have it all worked out.
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
You're a fool!
To the Bastille.  And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Well... Well... Okay.
Why didn't you say so?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
The King killed my son!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
What is its antidote?
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Yes, your Majesty.
Thank you, Keeper.
Eh?
Yes, yes, go on.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Sire, I --
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Right behind you.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
And who are you?
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Up north.
No...
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What did you do then?
Yeah.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Screw him!
Did you have sex with her?
County jail - get in.
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Book code?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Read it.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
I know...
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
No.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
What?
You wanna watch this or what?!
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
What?
How far away's the back-up?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
In eight days.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
It's a surprise.
I have work to do at the plant.
Are you okay...?
It's me.
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No!
Was I in an accident?
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Yes.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
No.
Uh... sure...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Most people are.
He only bit women so far, right?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
You got a deal...
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
We don't know that.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
...after a while.
No.
I thought you would have some ideas.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You had disadvantages.
You're insane.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Fight what?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
I hope you have a second chance...
Tank you veddy much.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
George, I hate sitcoms.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
But wasn't it funny?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
You've got good days and bad days.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Andy!
Deal.
I'm here, ain't I?
If you want...
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
It is apparently not working.
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
They're gonna lynch him!
It's my name.
You all look the same to me.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
It's Choi.
Right...
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
You killed them.
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
He's going to pop!
What happened to them?
Goddamnit!
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
How do you know all this?
... Yes.
What truth?
More important than what is when?
Wild, isn't it?
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Because... I didn't think I would?
The body cannot live without the mind.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Yes.
That I would find the One.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
I need the main wet-wall.
Do it!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Who?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
From you.
What?
No.
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm coming with you.
No.
They're hacking his mind.
Duck!
Tank, it's me.
Thanks.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
Be careful.
'And with your spirit.'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
She don't look Jewish.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
And say what?
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
No, she isn't.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
That's not going to help.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No.
Good idea.
That bad, huh?
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
How much was the original loan again?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Yeah, where's the rest?
Fine.
No you weren't.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Teresa.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Did you?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I know...I know.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Love that name.
He's cute.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Who?
Annie made them.
'Goddam party'!
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Here...
Thank you.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
What?!
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Please, Drew.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Joe, you do get around.
Are you?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Well, that's very interesting.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Make it go 'way.
Yes.
Rass!
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Sure.
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
I'm lost.
I'm sorry.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I haven't.
I don't have any.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Yes.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Gay?
I said get out.
I don't know who you are.
I am.
And you can't tell me who you are.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Thank you.
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
Not at all.
Good night to you, Bill.
No.
Oh.  Okay.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Absolutely.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
I guess...
You tell me, Bill.
Goodnight.
Then I can't help you.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Well, they're mine now.
Does she know where she's going?
Get him in here.
I guess you have your reasons.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
Speak up, please.
Then don't.
I think you know --
I'm here.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Thank you, Quince.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Hi, honey.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
...Then don't.
You're only six-five once.
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
It's something.
Joe?
I don't understand.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I agree --
So you're a one-girl guy?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I think I know her.
That's it.
I'm sorry... um... ?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Seen you together, that's all.
What?
When was I in here?
Just two. So far.							  *
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
I forget.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Quiet!
I don't want blood on them.
You told me.
Tell me about her again.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Just relax.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Are you Teddy?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
It's good.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Probably left it in your room.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Shut it, Teddy.
What's wrong with this one?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
Why are you following me?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Somehow, I'll know!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
You can't just take it!
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Turn around.
"And" what?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
25% discount on the load.
And what is that?
Havana.
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Zero risk.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Do I need it?
When?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I'll be on board by noon.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
Something's wrong.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What kind of weight?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
As in...?
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
This is Agent James Fujima.
To recruit you.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Have faith.
Sonny...?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
I don't understand...
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
"Future" of...?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
What's that supposed to mean?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Yeah, well, so?
Yeah.
What of?
Who?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Get outta my way.
Get down -- where?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Getchmis...?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
What?
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Stop shitting me, man!
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
For the money... )
Sixty?
Not far. Just a little way.
I'll pay extra
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Would you recognize him again?
But didn't have heroin.
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
He wasn't even in the car?
What do you mean?
What's that?
Section 13?
Yeah.
You know where it is?
Max - where?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
That's a great philosophy.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
New York's finest.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Oh, man, there you go again.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Depends.  You got a memo?
The kid's with them!!
Across both tracks!!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Please.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
I'll be late.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Susan, we're not b-
No.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
That's camouflage...
How?!
The scent won't last...
Your arm, you can't...
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Sure.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
--my number one fan.
I guess that means it's okay.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
My pleasure.
Misery?
I DIDN'T...
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
C'mere, I'll show you.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Have to wait.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
To Misery.
Why would you lose me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
You don't know?
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What?
He's your client, huh?
You think he might be missing?
Maybe you can, Libby.
If I can.
No, the typing kind.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
That'd be a first.
Great.
Not possible..
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
What else?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
What are you talking about?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Exactly where is she?
Not for seven more minutes.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Uh-huh?
- torque wrench.
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
And six billion in the world.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Ethan, tell me -
How do you suggest I go about it?
Oh Ethan!..
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Why did you phrase it like that?
You mean it'll be difficult.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yep.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
They'll kill me.
You're right, of course.
What about him...?
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
May take a little time.
Krieger.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Roger that.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your God damn coat!
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
You're sure about this?
Bastard!
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Why was there another team?
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
Profitable.
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why don't you come back with me?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Where exactly is it?
We'll see.
Jack.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Very well.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Keep counting Claire.
I think I might just take that look.
No, I'm going.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I'm going to marry him.
He knew my husband who died.
Yesterday.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You really are stupid, you know that.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I was dead, too.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
That light.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
I can't!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
For what?
Awful?
Yeah.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
You're late!
That's right.
Why?
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No?
She was too young for him.
What?
Bobo, take the cart away.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How about a month from today?
Who is he?
You have a brother?
I must ask for that back.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
A wife knows.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
You should think about this.
I don't know.
I came right from the airport.
It's late.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
You don't know where Loretta is?
What happened?
It's nothing!
I'm a housewife.
Why do men chase women?
Yes.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Good night.
What? What?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
I knew she had it.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
What do you mean?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
We don't have a lord.
Who are they?
We want ... a shrubbery!
And not too expensive.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Come on you pansy!
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What does it say?
Quite.
A G...g...g...
Man!
Yes.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
Do me a favour.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
Blue.
What is your name?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I can't take him.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
What - the curtains?
I was saved at the last minute.
Yes?
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
We're coming with you.
Oh, I see,  Right.
Sir Galahad!!
They're doctors?
We must examine you.
Please ... we are doctors.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Get out.  Out!
I can't move to tidy.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
Whom you address.
Out of my way!
It is quite late enough.
My own.
Who'll bring it to me?
Yes.  I do.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I am a blank sheet.
Why?
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
They aren't as watchful as you.
She's well, too.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
Of course.
Just them?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Why?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
He is sick, ma'am.
Sure.
How do you do that?
He?
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
Hey, kid.
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
No way.
She thought Benz was at school.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Right, then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
We don't have a choice!
Then we'll go home.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
Is that your question?
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Sign me up.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
You're broke!
I'm just offering a place to stay.
There is no problem.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Whatever.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Are you okay?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
But you won't.
Before what?
Diane?
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
You don't remember anything else?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Maybe it's not me.
I'm not sure about this.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Okay.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Yeah.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Interesting.
Damn, that's a long drive.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
What ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here, remember ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Knock yourself out.
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
Not yet.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
What do you mean sir ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I was.
No I am not.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
I think I'll see hat action.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
Thank you.
Sure.
Hi. I brought some wine.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Zach from work ?
Where are we ?
No.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Are you writing a poem?
Ohhhhh.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Me, I'll know!
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Have fun.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
How about a nice glass of milk?
You're being narrow-minded.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Does she?
You are?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
It's just a corpse.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Then I have come to the right place.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
MOM!
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Just give it to me!!
Leave me alone!!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
For the mini-bike fund.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Committed.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
You want me to come with?
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Not exactly.
She'll be all right baby.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Hey! Oh look.
You have no idea.
Vada!!
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
This guy bonking you?
I'm impressed.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm sure she will.
It's no big deal.
Okay.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
It's nice.
What happened to her?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
You can get the general idea...
Perfect.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Then who's it for?
Any more soda left?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Hi.
There were just too many of 'em.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Hi, is Vada home?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Thirty five dollars.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
He likes her.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Yes it is.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I'm eleven and a half.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Liverpool?
What are you saving for?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Hey, where does it say that?
It's my mother.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I stopped that!
Duck!
I am running faster!!
Like they do on TV?
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Kindred spirits.
The man you love.
Someday she'll thank you.
That was Thursday.
To belong to someone.
Well, we're...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Only.  If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
I love him.
That's entirely understandable.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
Nobody has.  So far.
Such as.
Quite the little eccentric.
Till the gas ran out.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Well.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
It means a lot.
A bad combination.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
Oh, yeah.
DON'T SPEAK!
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
If you find her...
MICHAEL!!
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
You're much more his type.
I know that, Star.
I see.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Green.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
He knows better.
How is that?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
You know better than that.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Minimum.
To the bathroom.
She's in Paris.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Well, he's really amazing.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Nash.
Oh... Well.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes, it is --
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Linnea?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
That's unkind.
Fifteen minutes?
Linnea?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Money's no object.
Hundreds of times.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
You're real favorites of his.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Out.
Mary?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Just a minute.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You do?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Sure thing.
Yes you are.
Yes, you are.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Are we in a big hurry?
Don't stop!
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Thank you, sir.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Susanville, Soledade.
By all means.
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
Yes, sir.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
I'm keen with anticipation.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
I'm sure we will.
Sure.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Yes.
No. Not really.
We are.  Your camera.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Just for fun, I guess.
They actually apologized.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Next week's episode.
Wayne---
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Yeah, sure.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Is that her real name?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
See Duff. He's the money man.
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
Where's he at?
Guess I don't.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You must be new in town.
Went to college, huh?
No.
You got a problem all right.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
What d'you mean?
Just for the day?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Come here, baby.
You didn't answer my question.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
What the hell could you do?
Watch out!
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
'Got a good thing, man.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'Bye, Jocko.
Okay.
Plannin' on getting married?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
That's right.
Okay.
I said, she's in great shape.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
That's right.
Thank you.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
'Musta knocked her up.
I know.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
I ain't drunk, honey.
I'm fine.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
No. I only needed the code from you.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
It hasn't yet.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Can you read my mind?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
It's Case. Remember me?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
Jah guides us.
What?
How are we doing?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How long, Dixie?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Case.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
What's my end?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
A regular Fagan.
Something exotic I hope.
What is it?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
What?
What are you talking about?
Nice.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Petty good.
If you say so.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Transitioned?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Have you been there?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Do you think you'll find her?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Why?
Nah uh.
Who are you guys?
We went through the door...
Everybody knows about--
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
I know.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Ken!
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
He's dead, you bitch.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
What the hell are you talking about?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
I don't know.
What's this?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
He's real.
He's heavy in the halls...
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Why is that?
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Everybody take five.
Anything?
Your dreams?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
No.  We're alone.
Mary Helena.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm a vegetarian.
Now you're lying.
I'm not listening.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Fifteen million dollars.
Fine.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
And what happens next in the dream?
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
She left me.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
Come in.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Okay.
Who is it?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Yes -- sort of...
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
And we intend to use them!
Me?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Is it someone we know?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
No, no.  She doesn't.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
No, 'fraid not.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
What book?
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Would you like to start?
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Mister McMurphy!
Yes, ma'am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry, ma'am.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Right!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
O-o-o-oh...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
M-M-M-Mack?
Thank you.
No.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin', Mac?
They went that way.
Hey, what's that?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Through the ass.
Your buddy is callin' ya.
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
I'm not running a charity ward...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Me. Hit me!
Hold it a minute.
Yeah, it's cold!
No.
I see.
I see...
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
I'm afraid not.
'Kay!
I'm the next one.
Because I quit breathing.
Oh, yeah?
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Yeah, what's up?
You's better believe it, brother!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
To help you relax... please...
No...
Hi.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Tha's your problem.
Evenin', ma'am.
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, yeah...
Of course not.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
What for?
Your hair... is perfect.
You're sure...
Yes.  We did.
Your great aunt.
Oh no.  Do you?
Except possibly that.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Hi there...
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
Yes.
What?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Where's Positano?
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
Well, good.  Good for you.
What are you doing here?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Yes.
Beautiful place...
Well, not exactly...
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
No.  He smokes.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Oh.
What about your job?
Are you sure?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What'd you find?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Her brother.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
I'll be back before you leave.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No one's perfect, Kate.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
I thank you.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
That's exactly what you are.
No, why?
No.
What?  You know him?
She didn't give me a chance.
That's really romantic.
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Gimme.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
It's a living.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Thicker than water.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
I know. I know.
I could have been better!
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
None of your business.
Which side are you with?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
How would you've done it?
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
Good. So do I.
The things that go on.
I don't know.
I am?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Go ahead, wear it.
Who says?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Get away from me.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
He wanted to see me again.
You are like—
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
What?
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Raise a hand to me and... .
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured—  They got it made. Eat all they want— fly around like crazy— sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Forty-five bills.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
You ratted on us, Terry.
I was only talkin' to her.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I'm afraid I'll faint.
What can we do against them?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Of course I do.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then why do you shake so?
I'm so frightened.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yes, it is.
What?!
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Really.  Hm.
Who are you?
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
Yes, she did.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
All you gotta do is get in.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
It was an unusual experience.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I don't smoke.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
A little.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
I thought so, too.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Who was it answered the phone?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I can go to the bar.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
That's not what you were about to say.
Why are you mad?
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Okay.  How many going out?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Five point two.
I'm not leaving Midge.
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
Hejira.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
Gimme another hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Oh...
He said he stayed with Maurice.
The State Theater?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I'd like that.
No?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
It's possible.  Why?
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He was that good?
Hale-what?
Sir, I --
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Kill the bastards!
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Little less.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Hang on.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Thank you, Sir.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
God help them.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Charlie! Am I dead?
Pretty strange.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Maybe I blocked it out.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
How'd you know about that?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Right here. Now sit down.
What?
It opens, too. Look inside.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
I'll just set it right here.
Of course.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I hate chickens.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
What a treat.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Doing some shopping?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
What do you mean?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
I don't know.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Richard, take it easy.
Give me some credit, will you?
Wbat're you talking about?
When do we start?
Come on. You can't be serious.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Wait! I'll go with you!
I... um...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
Anywhere but here.
He pissed me off.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
What do you mean?
You know everything, don't you?
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
One hour!
I promise!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
A carrot?!
Don't do this, Andy.
Sounds delightful.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Funny.
Continue.
We?
Continue.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Not bad.
Sure. It's fine.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What happens?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
No. I didn't.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
You bet. We'll see you later.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Not unnecessary ones.
Gay movies.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
That's right.
Is that a question?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Right.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Who?
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
My lettuce is wilting.
Night, honey.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Any women on board?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
<u>What</u>?
Show me your eyes.
Had it with deals.
<u>Listen</u>.
Think about what?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Don't do this to me....
It's starting....
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Tell me it's not a mirage.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
That's what I said.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
We're just burnin' light here.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
And what about the cells?
There is no "safe."
Which half?
I'm born-again.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Well, you got the big gauge.
About the girl.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Just the same, I want one.
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What are you doing there?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
No, they won't -
Zira....
Yo!
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
That way.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Sustained.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Huh?
Let's take a look.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I'm for that.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Taylor, please --
We can't.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Where's Elias come from?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What are the heads?
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Yes?

I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I haven't been invited.
Would you mind?
Possibly, Miss.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
What did you say his name was?
Whatever you say.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
I'm different. I like it fine.
They know you here--know your name.
I didn't notice him.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
You don't know who he is?
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Killaine...
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Killaine's wise to what?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Frozen.
Including Killaine.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Do you think I was faking?
Ale. I don't mind.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
It is?
Is it a crime?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
What does he see?
What will they do to you?
Goodbye, Betty.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Got the information on you?
Why not here?
Fascinated.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
Round of golf Saturday?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
What?
Did I do something wrong?
How would you know, Brandon?
I don't think you locked your door.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
He saw my face too.
With what motive?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
You get it's brother.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
I've met her.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Pretty big chance, huh?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Warm water, no doubt.
Not quiet yet.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
She might.
How do you do, sir.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Not too far, I hope.
Why should I mind?
It's kind of you to see me.
He was delightful.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Yes.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
Thank you.
I think it went on rather too long.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
How nice.
Who?
I haven't really thought about it.
I might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
That'll be fun
I know.  I'm sorry.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
To the Fleet.
Come on.  Hand over.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Dad.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
You'd look naked without one.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Not yet.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Not so far.
Babes.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
The shit they pull, huh?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Did he rob it?
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
They took a left at the next light!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
No way, old buddy.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
This gets better by the minute.
They're getting better equipped every day.
We're going to need everyone.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
The best friend I ever had.
What's that, General?
Hawkins?
Twenty-five percent.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
The price just went up to ten.
Sit... and spin.
Not exactly.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Fine.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Can I have some chips?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Oooh, thank god.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I sell them.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Any good?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You're forgiven.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I have work to do.
He's good at what he does.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Shush.  Of course you can.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Give me twenty minutes.
Let him answer.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Was that you?
Yeah.  I just got it.
Go for the bucks.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Rent.  You're late.
Okay.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
It's very expensive.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
I think it's great.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
You're a silly girl.
Should I be?
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
And what am I?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
I will never doubt again.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Veer left. Left. Left!
I thought I was going faster.
I'm waiting!
-- what? --
The body?
Over the Albino, I think.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Yeah. It's really good.
I don't be-leeve this.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
DEATH FIRST!!
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Who won? How did it end?
Yes.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Are you a rotten liar.
What's that?
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Nothing comes to mind.
Again. Thank you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Tell me.
No one of consequence.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Inconceivable!
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I will. And I choose --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
A little bit.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
I'll wait in the hall ...
Ooooooops.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Mr. Bialystock ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Right.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
With whom?
Yes.  We would!
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
Vat?
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
We won.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Or arrived with her.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Money.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Sam, if she's here...
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Don't you know?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What do you know about it?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Without calling me?
Does that mean we can't...
You're not.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
I have?
No.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You'd know, of course.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Very early. Dawn.
Crane.
Then I'm free to go...?
Why?
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Do what?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Did she talk?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
You found Buckley?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
I'm going to call the police.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
I'm losing my blood!
Yes!
But ... the dogs...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I don't agree with you.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
The body of Joan Gale!
What do you think I am?
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
How's every little thing?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Horsefeathers!
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
He can't hear you.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You taking any medication?
It's an experiment.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Well, I got to see her.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What is it, Rose?
You were pretty bad, huh?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
He did?
I don't want to know...
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, a little.
Yeah, he's still up there.
But how would you find him?
Well... maybe...
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
She's getting herself up to go out.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
What are they doing?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
Yes, of course.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Honey, please...
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
I... I'll get the grits.
There are more on the other side.
Well. What kinda job is it?
What?
Mine.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, I remember it.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Yes, ma'am.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I don't mind.
Incestuous.
What and?  That's what I got.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'm just saying...
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Bullshit.
What was I supposed to do?
Follow me.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
There'll be other chances.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
No you're not.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Out here.  On your knees.
Your wish is my command.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
I can't see.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
I don't know.
Ahhh...
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Lando!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Come on! Come on!
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
We shall double our efforts.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Never-r-r!
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Yes.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet.
Yes.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
It's alright Janet.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Goodbye
Now I
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
No no no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...I don't know.
Ohh!
By accident?
...I suppose.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I don't think I belong here.
Don't tease me.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Yeah...
Apollo?
What're we going to do?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
One more round.
...Thanks.
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Very high an' very fast.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Move your shoulders down.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
How 'bout some Cokes?
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
What's happenin' here?
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
You think I don't hear things?
Black market?
Stuff it, man!
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...No.
Ya puttin' me on?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Ya got heart.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Real good.
...The guy's great.
Fine... That guy's great.
It ain't your locker no more.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
'Bout what?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Looks, huh?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
Let's get outta this stink.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
...Tight.
...No.
What?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
What can I do about it?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Well, I'll be...
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Toon cops worked me over.
No...
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Why didn't you tell me?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
That's what you woke me up for?
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So's the job.
I've already seen your photographs.
No, I don't.
Aah!
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
No, it's not.
Forget it.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Yeah?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Leave Me!
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Then I'll leave thee.
Why, what is Tybalt?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
At thy good heart's oppression.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Ahhh!
If my heart's dear love--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
NO! Mercutio!
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Do you really think so?
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Who the fuck are you?
And who are you?
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And then...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
I thought I did.
Not yet...
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
I think not.  After you...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
But you hate each other!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
It's done.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
Really?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
But first you have something to take care of?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Jujitsu.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
A lot of people died.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don't have to do this.
You see the bullet?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Right now?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Closest and oldest.
I'll work on it...
Gone.  Destroyed.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I'm alright.  And you?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I might know where you could get a copy.
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I don't know what you're -
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Never heard of it.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
We'll figure something out.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
What are you thinking?
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's NOT too late!
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Uh huh.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Just take it in stride.
Shut up, Jesse.
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
What's that?
What for?
You deserve it is the occasion.
How the hell did he find it?
Great...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
A week ago, at most.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
What?
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
We appreciate that.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Anything...specific?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Have I seen her?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Take it or leave it.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well you're not getting, either.
So I want the money and I want it now.
You're never getting that much.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Anything in it?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
So what's your story?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
That's right.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
I knew you were lying.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Ask me if I give a shit.
What?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
No.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No mu-shu.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Who's Benjamin?
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
No.  I'm going to find out.
I did!
It's worth it to me.
This money is evidence.
Fine with me.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Excuse me?
It's my responsibility.
Did you tell Sterling?
Thank you.
Don't.
Ricky Tan?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Sir, I can explain.
No.
Did you make the plate?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Come on!
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Good God, ya'll!
No, fish is a PM food.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
What's wrong with that?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
It's okay. For restaurants.
At this point we don't have much.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Good one!  Thanks.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
It's hurting.
He's here!... He's here!
"Make the shot."
What?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I don't know.
Then come for dinner.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Thank you.
Originality is my speciality.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Twice...
You afraid to try?
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
You don't know.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Can you fix it?
Missed me bad, huh?
I'd rather not.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me?
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
So am I.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Quick.  Very quick.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
What is it?
Does it have wheat in it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
What?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
No.
Becky?
He said hello.
So I mailed your letter.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I'm not. 
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Walter and I are engaged!
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
The cabinets have to be redone --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What's she talking about?
It's hard to imagine.
Why not?
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
How about rapacious and love- starved?
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
What's tira misu?
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
P.  Dad?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
What?
What was?
I don't know.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
She's going to cook something for us?
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Well...
Microwave.  Five minutes.
You look good yourself.
You did?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I read the same article...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
An American.
They are singing for me.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Got to talk to the brothers.
What's more important than sanitation?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
He'll have it good. Some day.
What makes you so sure?
Can be what?
Yes.
I've had them since the day they were born.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Hunting.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Everything go?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You get off on abuse or something?
What happened to your eye?
Never heard of him.
Nothing.
Therapy session is over.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
What?
Guess it's our turn.
You don't say.
10%.  That's ...
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy
You aren't coming with me.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Anything for a dear friend.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
What?!
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Jesus.
It speaks!
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
They have. But they never found a lab.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
That is so unfair.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Now that's scary!
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I thought you were done.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out, Captain.
The Army gave you that?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Cap'n...?
Like hell, you did.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
You think the rest of us were?
But, sir...
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Simpson.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Hell of a mission.
That's not what we're here for.
Maybe.
You're kidding yourself.
It doesn't take this.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Just what I want to do.
I'll do my best.
Yes, sir.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
But, sir...
Ours is not to reason why.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
That's a mystery to me.
Here they come.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
And Sarge?
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Captain, he's fast!
We know.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
What about you, Captain?
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Good for her.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, give it up.
C'mon Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Bon voyage.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Yes, I...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
You're right.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Well, not monumentally.
Eight.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Bye.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Come on.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
What did you say?
This is so noble.
Yeah.
You're cold.
No, we don't have to say it.
We decided...
No, no.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn't.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, you're bringing me down!
No.
No.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I'm totally and completely serious.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
She's very successful.
Your car?
No way.
What?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah, alright.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Oskar, please -
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
What's going on?
Look -
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Look it up.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pistols?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Do what?
I think it's too late.
Yes.
They're withholding payment.
You did so much.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
thought he was doing AA.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Stop it...
Who is this?
I live here.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Finish what my son started.
What guy?
Tuition’s expensive.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Can we turn the light on?
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
Whatever.
That's not the way we play the game.
It's what you want from me.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Watch your back.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Don't do this.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
I counted four.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Where you going?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Good bye Ben.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
What did you know about your mother?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Do you want us to come with you?
Who is it?
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Who?
Yeah.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What are you talking about?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
No one's saying you did.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Or even a good porno.
You don't still think it was me?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Who is this?
To apologize.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Do you like scary movies?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
You getting scared?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Or else what?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Sure...
NOOO!
Turn off the light.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Then what are you doing here?
Mind if I join you?
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
...yeah...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Not yet.
How is everything?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
What about the cellular phone bill?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Call the police.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Not my daughter... not my...
What's the delay?
Yes, that's right.
Forget it.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
That's the original part.
Hello Sidney.
Who are you?
...out at the airport...
Before she dumped him for Steve.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
And you believe it?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Deal.
I did. He's full of shit.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
What are you talking about?
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Sit back.
Shut up!
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
No.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Forced what?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Okay.  But, what?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Just wait!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
No.
Yes we do.  Here...
And so what?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
We're focusing.
That is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Kiss me on the lips.
I can't do this now... please.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I'm sorry, I only...
He mentioned it.
How should I know?
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Yes sir...
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
How many, would you say?
Now mount up, son...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
I'm Clayton.
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
You've done a lot of growin'...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Because she's my...my...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Think it might be...?
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
No...not yet...
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Finish your breakfast...
It isn't fair...
Only if I'm dead!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
It still worked in town.
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Hi, darling.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
And the title of this piece?
It's good.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
See you in jail.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
Done.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Who is that?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
A share of the profits.
Oh, that.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Nobody knew!
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
I did not.
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
The daughter of his enemy.
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Oh, but they can!
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie.
You cannot marry Wessex!
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
and thus unable to declare her love
My lord.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
But why me?
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Do you understand me?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
What?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
Have you seen him?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Come on, David.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I want to talk now.
Now.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
About the mail --
But there's no --
What does it look like?
That's all?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Really?
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Not usually this drunk.
What I am.
-- which is a hack.
Yeah.
You're right.
His car's still there.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
I'm just looking.
What?
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Don't you?
Oh, good.
And the money?
It's the only way.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
Yeah.
What about?
No, three. Who said there were four?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
What?
No one. I promise.
It was on the television.
Right here?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to see the rest?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Did he sound upset?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
I'm a doctor.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
I mean, that's what it's like.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
My keys.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to see you anymore.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I hope she's all right.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Uh-uh.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
It isn't?
Hello.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
I am not!
Yeah.
Buffums?
I've got heads here, Norman.
Oh fuck, Norman!
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
What about it?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
-- what?
Nothing.
Look who's talking.
Not me, pal.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
What's that supposed to mean?
No, man.
Wash her.
-- Oh yeah.
-- Oh my yes.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- why did you come in today?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Where?
What's gonna happen?
Keep moving --
How?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Do you really mean that?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Great.
Okay.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Ha, ha.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
Did you?
Yes it is.
In a way. But...
I'm better than the guy I work for.
When?
Okay.
Oh yeah?
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... this doing hair it's...
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well... who are those guys?
But...
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
No --
What?
Wasn't sure it was you.
I'll call you back...
And?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Fine.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Aren't you going to have one?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
See you later.
Who is that?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I guess not.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
I'm exaggerating.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- no.
He's a hairdresser.
Of course not.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- just wonderful.
No... how long did you say?
No.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
What was the Donner party?
Okay.
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
How does he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Yes.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Advocaat is it?
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
I'm a Wendy.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Pleased to meet you.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Your money's no good here.
Hmm, nice.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I can't really remember.
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
shut in together over long periods of time.
Royalty?
Oh, I'll say.
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
For getting a divorce?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Yeah.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
What did who say?
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Joey -- do it.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
You know that song?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Five a.m.?
I... I...
A novice.
She won't?  Why not?
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
What?
Are you sure?
Now you.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
We're nuns!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
They're from my old convent.
Again?
Don't you know it!
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Can do.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Like to who?
No food?
Useless distractions.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Come, Sister.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
I am?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
What do you mean?
You have a phone call.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Me too.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Even nuns have to pee.
They open a window.
Who are you guys?
It didn't happen.
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Which one!
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
That's what I figured, too.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
What?
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
They need guidance.
Master Hardenbrook...
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
I know it.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
True enough.
In test... what?
Baltus Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I doubt that's the end.
Tired.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
The skull is gone.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
No.  She has gone out.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
I didn't see none.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
May I see my mother?
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
I can't remember.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Good to know you, Karl.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Can I see him?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He does make some funny noises.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I don't reckon I know.
Yeah.
A little ol' boy.
I reckon.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
You don't want to give away all your books.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
He ain't ever okay to me.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Did Vaughan go home?
Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
Yeah.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
How long have you been standing here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Can I help you, sir?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
No, we have to get this story.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What's that, Sol?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
Not a peep.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I mean, it's a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Where to?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
And why the hell would you give me money?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
And these?
The refrigerator?
What does that mean?
How the hell did you get into the building?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
It was just a thought.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
In Manhattan?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
What time is it?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Are you going to be all right?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
You don't really want to know.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Is it yours?
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
I'm not going to do it.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
Carl Heine's type.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Pretty darn clear.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I have told the truth.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Still lashed to the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
He had no reason to.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bull fiddle.
It's private.  Go away.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
I'll say.
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
- Type O.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
You can both go take a flying jump.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Security.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
I may throw up.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Terribly sorry.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I'll say.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
That's ridiculous.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
You got some?
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
What's the surprise?
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Well, I'll come back later.
I hope so.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
- you got to be blonde -
Goodbye?
Who?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
William Morris!
No - funerals.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Every time!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Saxophone player?
Who are you?
Not very likely.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- riding to hounds -
They repealed Prohibition?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
I am?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Bon voyage.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
You poor, poor boy.
Thanks just the same.
What is it?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Me?
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
I never join nothin'.
I cut myself shaving.
You and who else?
I already told you.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Pub Golf?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, don’t be that way.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Um, just about everyone.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Not for a dog.
It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
I slept with your sister.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
A weekend?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Shampoo, got it!
What?!
Oh, cut the crap!
It’s my job.
Spontaneously combust?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
Hi.
You knew?
Of course, don’t be silly.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Hard.
Is there any other way to take it?
Will do.
Is he here in Borderdale?
I try...
Colored.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
But where is my daddy!?
No, Miss Johnson...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
You would do that, wouldn't you?
It was too dark, Daddy.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Come here, son...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
Thank you, Daddy...
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
That's right!
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Good night...
Yes, mam...
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
It's the heat.
He can't get up, Mama!
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I'm used to it.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Mornin'...
I'll wait till after the children.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
I wanta see Nathan.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Montana.
Pillow.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
Sheet!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Okay.    Not.
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Yes, hon?
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
I don't know.
It's... It's not good children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
For pooping, silly.
Kay.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Totally!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Yes?
What the hell is going on?!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, it was worse than that...
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
Hello, Brooke Shields!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Canada is saving us!!
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Yup.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
I'm sure I will.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Taylor, you surprise me.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Good help is hard to find...
That's me.
I know, I know.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
That's right.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Just considering our options... sir.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Sure.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Marry you?
It would matter to us.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How am I supposed to know?
Talk to him...Jesus...
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
It belonged to my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
When you get a chance.
It was a clearance.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
You got a better offer?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I couldn't care less.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Buzz Fazeli.
You made me hurt him!
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
What ever happened to just bowling?
How Mr. Kastle?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Whips...orange whips.
Won't your father help you with that?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Plan B is your dad.
Nothing.
Really? I kinda like it.
Why should I help that old fuck.
He's my father.
It?
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Suck my dick!
I'm not here to bowl.
I'm looking for somebody.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
I can't...
Yeah.  I heard you.
But she's --
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What was that?
Forty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
He's right beneath us.
They didn't tell me anything.
Geologists?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
I don't know.  That's the point.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
-- and then brought her down here --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Working on it now, sir.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
What the hell is going on here?
In a minute, sir.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
She's not gonna know, sir.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
I love secrets.
Wait -- down where?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Good theory, Ted.
What?
Yeah, why?
Beth --
Beth.
So what?
Where did you get this?
What?
You bastard.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
I would.  But my suit --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Still clear.
He what?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think, in the sphere --
But why is he doing it?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
I'll just boost the doses.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
Beth --
Where are you?
Your watch.
You think I'd really drink that?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Don't you know?
What?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It doesn't make any sense.
For whoever's in that thing.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm not being defensive.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
Gimme another explanation.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
You didn't say that about the food?
How do we decode it?
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying.  There.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Thank you.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Really?
What report?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Huh?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
You mean a picture?
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Not bad.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
He's bluffing...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, sir.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
They'll find its weakness.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Something... I've got...you don't.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
YAAAAAAAA !
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Funny...
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Carl can wait.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Alright, I love you.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am.
No way, ma'am !
Sure.
All bands.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Sir, yes, sir !
Hi, mom.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Uh, I don't know.
What is it, Rico ?
Yes, sir.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
To join with him.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Departure angle.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
You are what...?
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
This served the purpose.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Twelve seconds...!
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thrusters at station keeping...
I want him here.  Sit down!
Any reply from them?
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
There is no alternative.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
We're ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
You bet your life.
Who?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I beg your pardon?
Why did you quit?
It's about life.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Everyday things...yes.
Surest thing you know.
...I always thought so...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Cast stood me up.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Better idea...
You have to sign for it.
Oh, God...
Read the card.
It used to be the Old Mill.
I hurt you?
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Going home.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Carla was in the car, right?
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
That's so beautiful...
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
She wasn't in the...
What'll I do for fun?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don't eat vegetables.
Sure, what have you got?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Mr. Barrenger.
Who is it raped you?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
She's absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
I just...
I can't do it, Walt.
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
She won't stop crying...
Who got their heads cut?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
You were in the car with Bob?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
How about that.
He should be put in jail.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I'm out.
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't know.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Is he cool or angry?
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...the city council...
Yes, I hear it.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
...we can't lose the wind...
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
It happens.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Why does Rachel scream?
I live.  In the same country.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Like how?
Well.  It's for you.
Like a big sister.
Secret's safe with me.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
And...?
She is but an arriviste.
Don't. Take me with you.
Here.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Thank God for that!
This is my daddy's house --
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
See, I...
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Fine.
No!
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
So where are you?
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Have you still never told him?
But you're not <u>done</u>!
You think I didn't get that?
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Not to me.
And I'm supposed to care.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
But it's not on the schedule!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
I did it for her.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Nobody likes a snoop.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
You're not dying.
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Brad Kovitsky.
Are we.
Double.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Oh, yeah?
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Thank you.
Yes.
I did not go to high school.
Jesus was not bad.
He wasn't.
I know!
For rape and murder.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I do. I love them!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Nothing, I guess…
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Got a lot of homework?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
I dunno.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Gee, you're home early!
Sure, Dad.
Well, now you have.
No.
Thanks.
...gger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Any books you like to read for fun?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Eight, six, and four.
Thanks.
You should be.
Yeah. I know.
No, thanks.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
He did?
Oh.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Y-yes--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Why? Are we going dancing?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
We don't have time!
What happened!
What do you think?
What happened?
Used to Filmore, used to.
What are you talking about?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Even better.
He's in there...
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Richter-we got a problem!
Excellent...excellent!
I say we head out.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Don't be ridiculous.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
What?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
General Schmuck?
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
This is General Ripper speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Plan-R????
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
You're damned right they are.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Admiral Buldike?
They're coming in now.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
What?
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Call them every five miles.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Quentin, how's your gear?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
But I get a red light.
Roger.
But who would be chosen?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
And your mom.
What?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Ah!
Okay, okay.
Okay.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
What, they're looking for her?
She's in the van.
Buff...
Yeah, right, publicist.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Shit.
I can come visit?
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
No, no, whoa!
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Military marching bands.
Mm.
What was your name again?
Yeah?
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Pony and I are friends.
It does look good.
Thank you.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Just go home, alright?
Look, why do you care, huh?
I hate that.
Man?
It's a piece.
So you can give me more shit?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
I would've stopped it.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
No, no.
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Yes, you do.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Shit, Jeff!
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Like songs?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Camel jockey.
Oh, yeah?
It's pretty exciting.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
You do?
Oh, my god!
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
It's none of my business?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Hey, Tim.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Don't swear it's impolite.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
No...I've been pregnant.
And they get caught!
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
He is the Great One...
We were told you could "fix us up."
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Now how the hell can I help you?
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Hi, Artie.
Close, but no cigar.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
As for instance?
Into what? A lampshade?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
So long.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't want it now.
Whose house is it?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
If you love me, Joe.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I don't know.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What's that?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
This is the right day.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good night.
I think I'll read a little.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Goodbye.  Norma.
The doctor suggested it.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
Right with you.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Is that So?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
Sorry, mistress.
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you want?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
What's that?
No.
But I don't understand.
It seemed that way to me.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
What?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I could force you.
Can I quote you?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
How do you know?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
As brave as my father. As wise.
But what for?
It was just a trim.
It doesn't seem right.
He's nice.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
What? Palace? Hardly.
I knew it!
Why?
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Brad.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You thought that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Uh-huh.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
At one o'clock in the morning?
What are you doing?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Say what?
Say who?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
I'm tryin' to.
Columbia.
That what they call you?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Just the man I wanted to see!
God, that's what I keep you for.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
For what?
You designed it?
Watch out for them air pockets!
And do what?
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
Gus?
In other words, push this red button.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Where's the handle?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Don't bet on it!
She'll be fine.
Be my guest.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Lois, you're amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Maybe you wanted to.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
What else is ballast for?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Now This I want to hear.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
It will. Starting with your own.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Free!
If you say so. Here goes.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Stuff it.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Get the box, nephew.
You are . . .
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
We're running out of smoke.
Albert!
One of them should've been you.
Got it? Otis?
Well!
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
What the  --  !
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Huh?
Oh.
Not unless you can fly.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Jealous? Of what?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
La de da da...
I know...
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
There are none of them any good anyway.
He is. Usually.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
It's not bad.
Very much.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Otis...
It is for me.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
That's okay.
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
How?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
A while.
No.  It should be dry by now.
You believe that?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
That would complicate things.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
No.  A little sugar though.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Did he say what about?
Oh.
Okay.
Oh.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
There's the Prescots...
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Yes.
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Any criminal record?
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Nothing.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Don't even try to remember.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
How will he do that?
Nothing.
There's talk of that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Is "he" inside?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susan!...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
He goes out with girls.
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
At the bar - Sidney...
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Take a top coat.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
What ship?
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
What chip?
Those lying motherfuckers!
No one must follow your work.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Liquid metal.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Chill out, dickwad.
No problemo.
Smile?
No.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Dyson.
Where you going?!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Go!  I'll finish here.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
And Skynet fights back.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Your manner.
Yeah.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
I have a duty.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
No. Ours was damaged.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I wish to say something.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
No!
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I forget?
Show you?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Right. Claims assessor.
Absolutely not.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
The what?
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
What's that?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Cover...our footsteps...
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Who is in authority here?
Shut up.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
It was an accident.
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
It was a gift... from my brother.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You first.
You pull me up.
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
I think not.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Get out of my car!
What are you talking about... ?
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
You call them...
Where'd you get that gun?
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
No...
I have to show you...
Claire.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Boyfriend?
They'll be wanting it back.
Which grad-school?
Elizabeth?
Yeah.
Fun?
Okay.
I'm going to call.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Stop it!
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Have you gone to the police?
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Don't take another step.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
The key?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Why are you following me?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Sam...  Thank you.
You warm my heart.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Sure.
Do we still get paid for the week?
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What?
How could you do this to people?
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Nell, what do we do?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Fifteen dollars.
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
You're okay.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Well?
I don't know, you know...
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Then what good is he?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
I'm a gracious host.
Why not?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Eduardo.  Rama.
It was better than a telegram.
Did Jenny know?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Probably.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
How'd you manage that, then.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
He give me your address.
That's what was estimated.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Get seven years, did you?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
All of what?
And that is?
He had urgent business in the north.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Yeah?
No kidding.
Where else?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Good luck.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
So what.
Lemme break.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Walked.
Since when?
No trouble.
You know I don't live with him.
Yes, Ann?
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
We've certainly missed you.
Boy.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
No. Uh... family friend.
I don't understand.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
I can get it, yeah.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
But it's...
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How's that?
So?
You don't have to tell me anything.
*I* was with her.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, hell. Drink?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Yeah.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Huh?
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
Huh? No.
What'd he say?
Yeah--
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Ah.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
Uh... you're under arrest.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Where's the walk-in safe?
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
You're kidding.
I believed them.
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
What is it?
Not so loud.
I'd say we're in its home.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
Read it out loud.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
He's right.
Yes, I do.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Get back!  Now!
But at what a price.
What's that?
So what?
Eats them?
How about lunch?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
You have time to talk?
You were going to be married.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
A monster?
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Would you mind showing it to me?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Where did you see it?
All right.  If you're positive.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
Gone.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium!
I think... it means it's full.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
How?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
It has to be the reality.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
You think she'd go through with it?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Oh, yes.
That's right.  Lauren.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
So when are you leaving?
Nursery?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Your Dad?!
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
What?!
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
I think I'd like a little company.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You're the one talking to the walls!
Truman, stop it!
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Things always do--when you look back.
I'll try.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
--How do you know about that?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Into what?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Yeah, I did.
I know the name. Why?
And one little boy.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
I'm not sure. A virus --
What did it look like?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
It's locked?
Something sweet.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
All the equipment is brand new.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
For the purpose of what?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
I don't know.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have his number.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
He needs to be turned over.
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What's wrong?
Give a kiss to Edward.
I did, yeah.
If you believe that.
You're sure of that?
Like hell "wait."
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
It doesn't matter...
I got it.
That hoist, with the winch...
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
Yes.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Give her some cigarettes.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
They're forged.
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
In German?
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
What's the matter?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
Of course.
Thank you.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
No.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
I don't...
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Just around the corner.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Calloway.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
No.
Which side of the road?
Of course.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
What about?
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
And - Anna...
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You wouldn't do anything.
But he said he died instantaneously.
How do you do.
English?
Yes, sir.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Well make it your business.
I am not a bad man.
Joseph Harbin.
Yes.
Oh.
Yes?
Help you out?
Here.
Thanks.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
You can swim?
Two.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We swim.
Richard, you know something -
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
I don't, but...
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
I have a job.
People still need values, beliefs....
I don't care about money.
Disease? What disease?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
That's stupid. Why would they?
That's stupid.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
I'm stealing it.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What??!?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
No.
Get the fuck away from me.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
But I wasn't.
I can't say that.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Fine.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Number ten.
The mother.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
What kind?
... So am I.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Hello!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
I think I'll have a coffee.
In a lake.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
Don't.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Noireuter.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Enzo...
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
What room have you got?
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
What is it?
Thank you.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You say that because you have the title!
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
It's too loud for me.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
No... tell me.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
... Are you sure?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
You called the police?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
A stereo type alarm system?
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
It's Friday.
Good looking?
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What do you want to see him for?
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What are you doing that for?
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
I want to ask you something.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
Just barely possible - - yes.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I thought they came right past here ——
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
You a tourist?
And that is the last time any...
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
I’m fine standing, thank you.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
Yeah.
What about an untrained pup, white...
You... Fuck you!
Yeah... The Diplomat.
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
I certainly did, sir...
No.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Yes. How did...
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Okay. Recommended...
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Jah...
Does it matter?
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Have you?
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
An Austrian.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Excuse me?
I know his work better than I know him.
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Fuck...
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Majesty, I can't...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
I want to stay with you...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
No no, I'm fine, really...
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Yes.
Many things...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Go on to the next question.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Not yet.
No good?  This is a disaster!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
No...
That's now what I meant...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
No.
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Yes!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
In His name??
Really?
What for?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I don't think so.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
He'll be here soon.
Just over a year.
What are you doing?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What, I'm working, what?
Thanks.
Tough luck.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Do they?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
It certainly was.
You're out, aren't you?
They were taking you away.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Not this week.
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
In the attic.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Not yet.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
To be deaf?
There is something to be said for silence
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
That is good, yes.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I don't want to learn.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
On your piano, that is the swap.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Do I know any gigs?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
What's the line on Visitation?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
No.
Here.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
You think my play is bad?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
We'll be waitin'.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Why?
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Then why you doin' it?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Five and call.
Pass.
You're more gutless than I thought.
But what about all these other people?
Where's June today?
Where you goin'?
No.
What the hell for?
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
He cheats.
Yeh, he knows that.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
No.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Just a minute...
That is, if it's all right with you.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Give it to me.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Hello, there!
Disappeared!
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?
If you think it'll be all right.
Where are you going?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
I'm asking you.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Who's your candidate?
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Rosebreen.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
No.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Well, what?
Did you go?
I see.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I said all right!
Never mind.
Yes?
Good.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I trust you.
What'll I do if something comes up?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
Slim.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Hello, Mimi.
What do you think?
Well, don't you?
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
They'll want more than your word for that.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Six Martinis.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
I'll get some towels. 
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
You did.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
You talk as if I were Asta.
Looks like a hold-up!
That's a fact.
Huh?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Sure.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
Yes.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes.  Nick!
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Oh, God.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
For climbing.
Yeah.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
What am I supposed to do?
I told you; don't push me around.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
No.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
And let me guess who is.
Suppose I don't go for that?
What are you doing?
No you're not.
There might be something in there.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Mine.  Land mine!
Just be cool.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing here?
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
It's got to be going better than this..
Don't you touch it.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
I don't have a weapon.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Shi'ites, I think.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
We go this way.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Thanks.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
He's going to slow down.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
What?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He lived through that?
All last night he could have been--
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Permant cortex bond.
4732...?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
What's the matter with you?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Don't be so sure.
No one can see us now we're alone.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
When?.....How?
I was lost.
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
-Where?
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
What do you mean?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Off the scale.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
I don't know.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
We work fast enough for you?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Hey, I'm next.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Reilly! He's loaded!
Thank you.
Security.
Stay in the truck.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
I don't know...
Look who's talking, old man.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Ain't that a shit--
What?
Huh?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And diamonds in the front.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Very well, Jacques.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
No!
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
You've never been in Constantinople?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Just dull.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I hope so, too.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I've got to see you.
I know it!
Just as you say, Doctor.
I would like to.
Why should you?
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll take the Royal Suite!
What?
He recognized you!
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily!
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Yes!
This used to be my secretary's room.
That sounds sensible. 
Then I mislay my checkbook--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
How do you like my dress?
Lipstick?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You would?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
On the night table.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
And you expect me to believe that?
I don't believe it!
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Please!  Thank you.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
The ship will sink.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't drop it Rose.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Don't you mean work me?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I was tired.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
No.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
He does landscapes.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is crazy.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I'll be right back.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Right.
It's so cold.
I can't feel my body.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
That's enough.
You think she was really there?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
You had it the entire time?!
It's so unfair.
Goodbye, mother.
How'd you ever get away with it?
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Glad to see you again.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I'll say she is!
Yes--
Good-by.
Brett is the name.
Lonesome?
Lose?--I won a little--
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Make it five.
I'll be waiting on deck.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll watch for him, sir.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Get it!
Much better--thank you--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Sure, I'll go.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
She did?
In New York.
June? That's my wife's name.
So what?
She's in New York.
That's fine.
I was never stiffer in my life.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
No--not much--excepting-- 
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Good-night, folks.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Not a chance--I'm through. 
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Come and get him.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
In pace requiescat.
I was kidding about that.
Say when.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
I'll remember you said that.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
But Doc-
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Sorry...
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I know.  Me neither.
Colorado's closer
Never even heard of anything like it.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
I laugh sometimes
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Getting late.  We better get back.
I didn't mean it that way.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
That what you got me up here for?
'Least they don't scare women.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
I'll be damned...
I know.  And nobody can make him.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Yeah, and dangerous.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
What about the gold?
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Political considerations?
Well... If you insist.
He tied one on.
That's reassuring.
Three. You? Married?
I didn't think so.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
- The family jewels?
He was my father's best friend!
No. I'm going with you.
Up.
Trust me.
... We have time for that?
Don't say it.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Now.
Yes, M.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Sabotage?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
No -
Excellent.
You have to leave -
You come with me -  You stay here.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Why in the h...
Do you think you won?
Babe Brother.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
It would be nice.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
You must have been really sick.
What happened to your hand?
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
You must have done something to her.
Now who are we talking about?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
I already have, my dear.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Where was the last place you left him?
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Watch yourself!!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Sorry.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Don't tell me what to do!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Yeah, right.
Look out!!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Have you been replaced?
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
I thought he was at summer camp!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Sir!  No Sir!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Last present!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
I can't quite make out -- 
Huh?
It's busted.
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
I did like the music.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
H'm?
It was only a mouthful!
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
So had I.
Nothing is left but us.
We're too young.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl, that's insane.
Barbara --
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long's the job?
Like I give a fuck.
You can't make me.
Yes.
Yeah.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Nope.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
I don't know.
Depends on the state.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Where?
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
Everybody has a weakness.
Noriega is a criminal.
Any idea how much?
Any way we can do it better?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
What do you mean?
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
What?
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
It's Iggy Pop.
So why have you told me about it?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
It's an interesting theory.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Cheers.
Right.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Another dab?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Lewis Gilbert.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
So who else?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
What's wrong, Allison?
When are you going to visit him?
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
In that case --
Yeah.
Such as?
Are you serious?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
I don't have a clue.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Put it on the screen.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Because it's there.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Fascinating.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Hmmm?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
Now learn something about yourself.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
No. I will not.
I hide no pain.
I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Hi, Flynn.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
For sure...
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
End of line.
I'm sorry -
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
It can be arranged...
Hah.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Yes.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Shhhhh.
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Recognizers!
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
We have to talk.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
We have to.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Where are you off to young lady?
Fine.
You're kidding.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
It can't be.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
What are you talking about?
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes what?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Me too.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Do you still love your husband?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
What?
No.  Much more.
Dance?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
What about the husbands?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
He said he was an American agent.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm married!
Helen.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Nope.
You can't have just one.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
The letter he sent.
Now hang up.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Is that your real name? Really?
What do you do?
Very much. Now, where were we?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Five.
What would make you think that?
You didn't do nothing.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Really?
What?
Cancoon.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
So you do eat pussy!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
She's with me.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
It'll get ya high.
I know.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
Yeah?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
How 'bout me what?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
You were a cop.
No shit?
I got some money I can give you -
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
What about him?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Uh-huh.
I believe he believes him.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Yeah, I live here.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Uh, what?
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Meaning...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
July?!
What year is it?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
What?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
James, why don't we...?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You really want to know?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I'll be right here...just in case.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Think you'll live that long?
Out of here.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Twenty-after-ten.
Just a car.
Don't look like nothing.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Wrong number.
They look nice.
The wind isn't blowing.
I don't know your real name.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Like they're made of polyester.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Where?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
What about us?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You killed him!
Just drive.
You could give me the gun.
Grace!
I think I busted my leg.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Like you don't know.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
No.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
What makes you say that?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
Will you shut up!
Get away from me!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
I don't understand what the--
Sure, Sheriff.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
No!
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
What do you want for free?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Who's cursed?
You afraid of the dark?
You know I won't be seeing you.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up.
Give it to me!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
I was hoping we could talk.
You're talking like a madman.
Cause she's dead.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Will you shut up!
Get away from me!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yeah, I can fix it.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
You've been there?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What sign?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
No.
Eh?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You sure you can manage?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have an idea.
No.
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Yeah.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
No! You get it!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
But I thought --
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Bobby? Are you all right?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Harlin's.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
The ticket is 30.55.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
No baby, you got it wrong.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
There's someone in the house.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Yes.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Four.
What did I say?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Rust?
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
But not a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
You're skill.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
That's not what I witnessed David.
What's he look like?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I want to sleep here tonight.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
No.
Two hundred and seventy.
That's great.
Jeremy listen to what--
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
You ain't dead.
She back in Kansas?
Shit and fried eggs.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Oh yeah.
He admit it?
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Uh... Duke.
Give it to him.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Huh?
Lookin' at?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
What business?
You still think he's in there?
Yup.
Yeah?
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Huh?
Eleven.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Sally?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
You're marking us, Bill.
How far kin you see?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
He's dead, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Two more hogs got the fever.
Tom?
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
What?
Who said that?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Thought you was followin' me.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
I don't like the question.
Maybe.
We'll bury him.
An' if I spot 'em?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They ruined me tonight.
Alright.
A glass of water would be nice.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
I don't want to know.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You okay?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Kobayashi.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Kobayashi.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Then why didn't you help him?
I never heard of him.
Edie.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Very good.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
When she...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Yes...I...yes.
Yes.  I wrote it.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...things change.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Mr. Concannon...?
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Yes.  Price...
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
You're going to stay here...?
And what makes you so tough?
You, you don't under...
No...no...
No.
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
No.
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Read me what she said.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
She did?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
As I've said we had some more...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I married into it.
Then?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What about?
But you haven't lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Why?
Why?!
Honest?
No, it's not right.
Yes.
Oh, yeah. There.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
At...
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I... didn't know where you lived.
Wander about.
You've nothing to apologize for.
No! No, thank you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
What?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Madeleine!
Yes...
What?!
Yesterday.
Vaguely...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
All the time.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Let me go.
I won't lose you.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Please answer my question.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Sorry, old man. Work.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
That!?!
Nothing to tell.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Carlotta?
Wandering.
What is it, a still life?
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Can we have it by tonight?
Excellent.
What?
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
She's dead.
You're pathetic.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
I'm not getting a ticket.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You don't know what you're doing.
Why?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
There's more.
Have you ever done this before?
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I am not flexible on this.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
It has worked.
Later.
I know...
I don't think so.
Sweet deal.
Not tonight.
Left side.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
Give me two more.
Who's up for making some real money?
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Nobody knows.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
Hear what?
You're sick.
Israel doesn't have a King.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What?
They need leadership.
You will not screw this up.
Ball park sausages.
Goosed!
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
Of course.
With all my heart.
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
Nesting?
What!
I'm working on it.
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Move the bodies.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
I just want her to be happy.
I think so.
Did she believe you?
My God...
Did he try to kiss you?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
That's what I'm thinking.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Drum banging real times.
It's a present from my parents.
That one.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Who is she?
Come down.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
You must listen to me before you go.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
That your cousin is more to your taste.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Why?
Are you Jorge?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Things seem to be getting better.
Very, very?
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
When you are, miss.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Hello.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
Catch him and your record's clean.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
You think he's smart?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Not from in here.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'm still making adjustments...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
What you need is a collar.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
I'm still working on it.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Stop me.
I'm doing the best I can!
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...and...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
No, no, no...
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
All I need is the one day.
And you?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
...<u>nothing</u>...
In the yellow ribbon.
...take a long view.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
Gloria -- sell the House.  
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Where's my pill...?
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
...we own it?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I'll play your silly game.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
President's speech.
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Is he dead?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Why not?
...but...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
A proud tradition.
Watch me.
Why are they ...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Yes.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...

By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
...they... <u>you</u> know...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Oh really.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Coulda been a contender.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
About what?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
You speak for me, son.
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon.
I gather you're a decorator.
Upper West Side.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Businessman!
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Hmm.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you
A party at a waxwork huh?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Vell.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
That's not what you said last night.
Go away.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
That's not true.
So much.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Is everything alright?
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
Wait!  Don't go...
And then you weren't there.
No.  No, I don't.
She never mentioned her father.
I should be going anyway.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I don't know.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
What is it?
Did he say that?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I don't know...
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
Yup.
Of him I think.
That's not what I'm sug--
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Unless you need me to come home...
In the house.  I was scared.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Really?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Well, that's nice.
That's...
I'm so sorry.
What?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
What am I looking at?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
I...
What's wrong with me?
Stop...
What's the matter?
Claire--
How did she know where it was?
We don't know that for sure.
It's alright.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
'He'...?
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
The door, Michael.  find the key...
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Like this...?
It is from love.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I bring her flowers too.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
I don't know what you are!!!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What about you coming down here...?
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
That's GREAT!
Mm-hmmm...
No.    This is unreal...
- we made a fire.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You bastard!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
The one on the left - definitely...
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
BRIAN...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
You don't know?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
STEPHANIE?
I am sorry...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
At home alone - where were you?
Get out...
Don't worry about it -
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Well, Dad said...
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, whatever.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
I love those springy head puppies!
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Ladies first.  I insist.
But that smile.
Yeah? You like?
You have changed since second grade.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
I guess.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Some of them have to be automatics.
That's me.
Hi ho, Silver.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I meant biologically.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
I know.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I'm very aural.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
That's hard to believe.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Yellow pages?
But how would we pay our bills?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Of course I like girls.
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? You'd do that for me?
What kind of ideas?
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
And the child...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Take your time.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
And what do they say?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
You didn't cuff her?
I wanna go home now.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
What brain?
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Hello.
Okay.  I love you too.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
About what?
The one you bought at school.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Put Kelly on too.
Hi, Sandy.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Thank you.
Yes, me!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Really?
Would that include me?
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Nicely said, sir.
On my way to Denver...
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
I deal with some tough customers.
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Yes!
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Right.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Let's go.
Yes...?
Me?
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Are you a warrior?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.
Willow!
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Courage, Willow.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Who is he?
Queen Cherlindrea?
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
The sorceress.
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, why?...
Yes, sir.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Johnny –
Move! Or you die right here!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Home.
I was wrong.
No, no doctor...
But you can't.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Where's my baggy pants?
I hear you.
Say again?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
You'll be hist...
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Who are you?
You are?
Ohhh!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Why --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh -- yes.
Uh-huh.
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh, no -- no!
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Did you say something?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I knew you would!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
No, but you tried to.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes -- that's true.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
I -- Oh --
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
Hold still - hold still --
Whozat?
Don't push!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
Well, that's you all over.
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Th.D.?
Help!
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
The worm on the hook again.
The inside man?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
You’re not going to.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
I think you do.
Not interested.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Oh James.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
No!  Get me out!
How would you know?
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
You're the only human being I care for.
Veidt¹s complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
The missing scientists.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
The costumes.  Am I right?
That's because --
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
We should get back --  What?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Is that a fact?
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm through, Xander.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
What's the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
When else are you gonna do it?
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Its core?
For what purpose?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
Into the Hudson?
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
He's busy right now.
He takes his work seriously.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
I'll go.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Poppycock!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Baack!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Of course.
Very....very!
Goodbye, darling.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
No.
Just putting up some tea.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
If you like -- just hurry!
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Who are you talking to?
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
That's what we're paid for.
It's alive!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Me?  Sing?
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
But will they make good use of them?
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
